The flexible laryngeal mask airway (FLMA) is a type of 1st \ngeneration (i.e. lacking an inbuilt gastric port) supraglottic airway that has been used in shared \nairway procedures since its introduction in 1990 [1]. The airway tubing can be moved out of the \nsurgical field, while maintaining a cuff seal against the larynx  [2]. Additionally, the wire-reinforced \ntubing resists surgical compression and the device itself acts as a barrier to prevent the soiling of the \nairway with blood and secretions. While SGAs have an excellent safety profile, there are still risks \nassociated with their use [3]. \nThe complications associated with the use of SGAs can be divided into two categories: \nrespiratory events and mechanical injury. Respiratory events include failed insertion, displacement, \nlaryngospasm, and regurgitation/aspiration events. The incidence of pulmonary aspiration \nwith the use of 1st generation \u201cclassic\u201d laryngeal mask airways has been reported in the range of \napproximately 1-2 per 10,000 cases  [4]. Mechanical injuries are those caused by the device itself, \nsuch as nerve injury from compression  [5], and trauma sustained during insertion and placement. \nMinor trauma as indicated by the presence of blood on removal of the SGA is relatively common \nbut is not associated with clinically significant adverse outcomes. Significant trauma to the airway \nis infrequent. The literature describes significant tissue damage in isolated case studies only  [6]. \nAspiration of blood resulting from a pharyngeal laceration has been described in a single case report \n[7]. \nWe describe here a case of soft palate and uvula laceration associated with the insertion of a \nflexible LMA during an elective anterior mandible alveoplasty and removal of teeth. Written \ninformed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report , and ethics \napproval was obtained through Central Adelaide Local Health Network (CALHN) Human Research \nEthics Committee (HREC). \nCase Presentation\nA 51-year-old male (114 kg, 187 cm) presented for elective maxillofacial surgery involving an \nanterior mandible alveoplasty and removal of teeth. His past medical history was significant for \nischaemic heart disease with previous coronary stenting on dual antiplatelet therapy, hypertension, \ndepression, chronic back pain requiring methadone, and active smoking of five to ten cigarettes per \nday. Of note was a history of snoring, with no formal diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea and no \nuse of nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). He had undergone a laparoscopic \ncholecystectomy several months prior uneventfully."

Anaesthesia \nwas induced with 100 micrograms of fentanyl and propofol. The \ntarget-controlled infusion was initially set for 4.0 mcg/mL. Using the \nrecommended technique, an attempt to insert a size five flexible LMA \nwas made. Resistance to passage of the LMA was encountered by \nthe initial operator. The cuff was deflated, and a second unsuccessful \nattempt was made to place the LMA. A third attempt was made by \na more experienced clinician, and the FLMA was successfully sited. \nSurgery proceeded uneventfully. \nAt the end of the procedure, the surgeon noted mucosal tears to \nthe right palatoglossal fold and uvula base (Figure 1). After irrigation \nwith saline and achieving haemostasis, the right palatoglossal fold \nlaceration was sutured with 4.0 vicryl rapide suture (Figure 2). The \nuvula base laceration was very superficial and did not require formal \nrepair. After resuming spontaneous ventilation, the patient was \ntransferred to the post anaesthesia recovery unit. The flexible LMA \nwas removed in recovery when the patient was awake. \nIn recovery the patient reported a significant sore throat and \nodynophagia. This was managed with viscous topical lignocaine and \nthe patient was deemed fit for discharge the same day. The patient \nwas reviewed by the surgeon post-operatively and recovered without \nfurther complication.\nDiscussion \nThe flexible LMA is a useful tool in the airway armament of \nanaesthetists, especially in head and neck or shared airway cases. A \nstrategy for airway management should be developed in consultation \nwith the surgical team. This plan should consider patient, surgical, \nand anaesthetic factors. Thought should be given  to the individual \npatient\u2019s airway, surgical positioning and access, the risk of airway \nsoiling, the risk of airway device dislodgement or occlusion, and the \nconsequences of airway irritability on induction of, and emergence \nfrom anaesthesia. \nA peculiarity of the FLMA is the tubing\u2019s lack of rigidity compared \nto other supraglottic airway devices. The device manufacturer\u2019s \nrecommended insertion technique requires the operator to use a \nfinger against the junction of the cuff and tube, guiding the cuff along \nthe palate until it has passed the tongue and proximal pharynx. This \ngreater directional force has been implicated in the higher incidence \nof sore throat compared to other SGAs\n [1], and was the likely cause \nof trauma in this case. This unique insertion technique means that \nclinician experience and familiarity with the technique are important \nfactors in successful insertion\n [8]. A randomised controlled trial \ncompared the standard recommended insertion technique with a \nlaryngoscopy-guided technique [9]. This alternate technique showed \nimproved final LMA position as verified by fibreoptic assessment, as \nwell as a reduced incidence of post-operative sore throat, likely due to \nthe increased ease of insertion. \nWhile the tonsillar laceration we describe was not associated \nwith significant bleeding, it did require suturing by the surgeon. \nThe traumatic insertion may have been due to excessive directional \nforce applied at the junction of the tube and the mask. An additional \ncontributing factor may have been inadequate lubrication of the \nLMA, the importance of which is stressed in the manufacturer \u2019s \ninstructions. Clinicians should be cognisant of the possibility of \ntraumatic insertion of SGAs, and if resistance to insertion is met, \nconsider an alternative insertion method, such as laryngoscope \nguidance in the case of a flexible or other 1\nst generation LMA, or a \ndifferent airway device. \nConclusion\nThis case highlights a rare but important complication associated \nwith the use of the flexible laryngeal mask airway (FLMA) during \nroutine anaesthesia. While supraglottic airway devices are generally \nsafe and widely used, their insertion is not without risk. The flexible \nLMA, while advantageous in head and neck surgeries due to its \npliability and positioning, may pose a higher risk of trauma due to \nthe increased force required during insertion and the technique-\ndependent nature of its placement.\nThis case underscores the need for appropriate device selection, \ncareful technique, and clinician experience when using the FLMA. \nIt also suggests that consideration should be given to alternative \ninsertion methods, such as laryngoscope-guided placement, especially \nin cases where resistance is encountered. In addition, thorough \nlubrication and prompt recognition of complications are essential to \nminimise the risk of airway trauma.\nWhile the injury in this case was managed successfully with no \nlong-term sequelae, it serves as a reminder that even minor airway \ntrauma can impact patient comfort and recovery. Incorporating \nlessons from such incidents into training and clinical protocols \ncan help enhance patient safety and improve outcomes in airway \nmanagement.\nReferences\n1. Xu R, Lian Y, Li WX.

Hand eczema (HE) and palmar psoriasis (PP) are two of these chief \ncomplaints that cause severe functional and social impairment and have a detrimental effect on a \npatient's quality of life [1,2]. These two types of dermatitis are close differential diagnoses where \nthe clinical features of HE differs from that of PP in that the latter usually presents with sharply \ndemarcated lesions without pruritus or vesicles [3,4]. However, distinguishing between the \ndiagnoses stated above remains difficult because of the tremendous clinical overlap between the two \nconditions and the difficulty in accurately diagnosing PP and HE due to the similar histopathologic \nfeatures of these conditions and their similar clinical responses to the systemic treatment [5]. And \nthe case would be more challenging if these two conditions were overlapping or coexisting were it \nhas different nominations such as \u201ceczema in psoriatico\u201d, \u201cPSO-Eczema\u201d or \u201cPSO-AD overlapping \nsyndrome\u201d [6].\nApremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment \nof moderate to severe psoriasis [7] and atopic dermatitis [8].\nHince, in cases where we doubt the diagnosis due to the similarity of the clinical aspect, \ninconclusive histopathologic reports and in cases of \u201ceczema in psoriatico\u201d, and taking into \nconsideration that apremilast works on the pathology of both eczema and psoriasis; Thus, apremilast \npresents itself as a convenient treatment for the cases mentioned above.\nCase Presentation\nA 40-year-old female patient presented to the clinic on March 2019 with pruritic lesions on her \nhands and feet in the past 9 years. The patient also complained from pain in her wrists. Physical \nexamination revealed multiple erythematous papulosquamous plaques with extensive fissuring on \nher fingers and both of her palmar and plantar surfaces (Figure1a-c). A single small erythematous \nand scaly patch was noticed on her post-auricular area. Her wrists were tender on examination. \nNails were normal with no pitting.

The patient\u2019s laboratory tests \nwere normal and the rheumatologic panel that was ordered only \nshowed elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Her previous \nmedications were topical corticosteroids and oral anti-histamines. \nHowever, the patient only had minimal improvement and continued \nto have a recalcitrant disease. Dermoscopic examination was done to \nthe dorsal and ventral parts of the hand; white and yellowish scales on a \nlight-red background were noticed (Figure 2a and b). Regular vascular \ndistribution was seen in the palmar regions. A biopsy performed on \nher palmar lesions showed acanthosis, para-hyperkeratosis, mild \nspongiosis in the epidermis, also exocytosis in the epidermis leading \nto the formation of some foci of vesicles. A dense perivascular \nlymphocytic infiltrate was seen in the dermis with rare eosinophils. \nPAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) stain was negative. The pathology report \nsuggested a spongiotic dermatitis which is an indecisive diagnosis. \nThis left the case with 3 possible diagnoses: Palmoplantar Psoriasis, \nHyperkeratotic Hand Eczema and Eczema in Psoriatico. So, the \ntreatment plan was putting the patient on Apremilast with gradually \nincreasing the dose during the first month of treatment until reaching \n30 milligrams twice daily, which resulted in significant improvement \nafter 6 months of treatment and approximately 90% clearance of \nlesions after 1 year (Figure 3a and b).\nDiscussion\nPalmo-plantar Psoriasis and Eczema are two diagnoses difficult \nto differentiate. According to different studies, the histopathology of \nPalmo-plantar psoriasis and dermatitis can have several overlapping \nfeatures, and sometimes there is no difference between palmar psoriasis \n(PP) and hyperkeratotic hand dermatitis (HHD) in histopathologic \nfindings [5,9,10]. Posada et al. conducted a cross-sectional study that \naimed to evaluate the usefulness of palmar and plantar biopsies of \nhyperkeratotic and vesiculo-pustular lesions. Results showed that \n88.3% of cases were inconclusive and concluded that biopsies from \npalms or soles with hyperkeratotic or vesiculo-pustular lesions had \nlow diagnostic yield [11]. A study was done by Yu et al. with the aim \nof characterizing the dermoscopic features of palmoplantar psoriasis \nand eczema, and results showed that the presence of white scales \nand a regular arrangement of dots and globular vessels are indicative \nof palmoplantar\u00a0 psoriasis, while yellowish scales and an irregular \narrangement of atypical vessels are indicative of palmoplantar eczema \n[12]. In this case report, results of dermoscopic examination were \nconsistent with the features of both psoriasis and eczema mentioned \nin Yu\u2019s et al. study. However, the histopathology result was \ninconclusive. Yu et al. concluded that dermoscopy can be an auxiliary \nform of examination that has shown to be valuable for the differential \ndiagnosis of psoriasis and chronic eczema in the palmoplantar region, \nwhich do not show differences in clinical features [12]. However, \ncorrelations between dermoscopic findings and histopathological \nfeatures need to be studied further. Hence, the question remains; \nwhat if the patient has both diseases? Numerous studies have \nshown that eczema and psoriasis may co-occur concurrently and \nconsecutively in the same individual [13,14]. Case reports of patients \nwho have co-existing psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Kolesnik et al. \n(2018) in his article mentioned that Positive history of psoriasis does \nnot exclude the coexistence of contact dermatitis, atopy or irritation. \na b\nc\nFigure 1 a-c: Multiple erythematous papulosquamous plaques with extensive fissuring on fingers and both of palmar and plantar surfaces.\n \na b\nFigure 2a, b:  White and yellowish scales on a light-red background in \ndermoscopy.\n \n  \na b\nFigure 3a, b: Improvement of lesions after 1 year of treatment with Apremilast \n30 mg twice daily."

Also surprisingly, the \nnumber of dermal CD8+ T cells in EIP outnumbered not only those \nfound in psoriasis, but also in ACD [15]. Many dermatologists claim \nthat AD and psoriasis vulgaris do not develop in the same patient \nbecause their respective immunological situations involve distinct \nreactions. Immune reactions of AD, especially acute ones, are Th2-\ntype reactions. Psoriasis skin lesions show none of the varieties of \nimmunological skin conditions and are characterized by Th1 cell \nimmune reactions. In chronic AD, interferon-gamma production by \nTh1 cells predominates over interleukin (IL)-4 productions by Th2 \ncells. This might indicate that the immunological reaction is reversed \nfrom Th2 to Th1 [16]. Paul et al.in his study showed that apremilast \nsignificantly reduced the severity of moderate-to-severe plaque \npsoriasis over 16 weeks on the efficacy and safety of Apremilast in \nmoderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp sowed that there was \nsignificant improvement of the patients at week 16 at a dose 30 mg \nBID with no new significant adverse events emerged with continued \nexposure for up to 52 weeks [17]. Also, apremilast showed a safety \nand tolerability pro\ufb01le that has produced clinically meaningful \nimprovements in HRQOL (Health-related quality of life), general \nfunctioning and mental health of these patients [18]. A study done \nby Abrouk et al. presented the successful use of apremilast to treat \n4 patients with chronic, severe, recalcitrant atopic dermatitis and 1 \npatient with hand and foot dermatitis [19].\nPatients with ACD show an increase in cytokines produced from \nT helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, including (interleukin) IL-17 and IL-\n23, which are also implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis [20,21].\nApremilast, a small molecule phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) \ninhibitor, has demonstrated clinical efficacy and tolerability in \nthe treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, likely through \nthe blockade of IL-17, IL-23, and several other pro-inflammatory \nmediators [22,23]. Therefore, it may provide an effective treatment \noption for other Th1 and Th17-mediated disease (such as CHD due to \nACD and ICD), which share a common immunologic pathway with \npsoriasis. Investigators hypothesize that apremilast has the ability to \ndecrease disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe CHD \nthat is either secondary to psoriasis, or occurring in patients with an \natopic or allergic past medical history. In a case report of an arthritis \nand nail psoriatic patient with concomitant atopic dermatitis, it was \nmentioned that the treatment of patients with concomitant psoriasis \nand AD can be complicated by the fact that tumor necrosis factor-\nalpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors and Ustekinumab, the monoclonal \nantibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23, \nhave been shown to provoke eczema or a flare of AD as a side effect \n[24]. As a result, systemic treatment with cyclosporine, methotrexate, \nand/or apremilast is preferable as these treatments can be efficacious \nfor both atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, including psoriatic arthritis.\nConclusion\nIn a conclusion, apremilast can be strongly suggested as a \ntreatment for indeterminate cases with overlapping signs of eczema \nand psoriasis, as it can work on the pathophysiology and effectively \ntreat both conditions without the need of laboratory monitoring tests.\nReferences\n1.

Therefore, it is important to formulate a \ncomprehensive treatment program that provides suitable individual protocols. Therefore, this study \naimed to introduce a novel comprehensive treatment program for this population.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective case series review of patients treated between January \n2012 and January 2024. Data were gathered from medical records and a comprehensive treatment \nprogram was formulated based on multidisciplinary team consultations. \nResults: The subjects, comprising both males and a female, were of Asian ancestry and ranged in \nage from 66 to 90 years. All patients underwent hemiarthroplasty for proximal femoral fractures \nassociated with comprehensive treatment. No complications were reported during hospital stay. \nOne of the six patients in our study died in the first year after hip fracture surgery and died of a \ncerebrovascular accident 8 months after surgery.\nConclusion: These comprehensive treatment methods included planned hemodialysis, prophylactic \nanticoagulation, anti-osteoporosis therapy, management of blood pressure and blood sugar \nlevels, and treatment of hyperparathyroidism. In addition, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular or \ncerebrovascular diseases, and renal anemia should be considered. Despite the lack of large samples, \nthis case series indicates a comprehensive treatment program and emphasizes accurate management \nbased on retrospective analysis. Thus, our study has a significant research value.\nKeywords: End-stage renal disease, Hemodialysis, Hip fracture, Hemiarthroplasty\nHong-Xia Zhu BN1, Yu Xie2, Lei Fu2 and Lun-Li Xie2*\n1Department of Traumatic Orthopedics, Hunan University of Medicine General Hospital, Huaihua 418000, Hunan \nProvince, China\n2Department of Joint and Hand Orthopedics, Hunan University of Medicine General Hospital, Huaihua 418000, \nHunan Province, China\nOPEN ACCESS\n *Correspondence:\nLun-Li Xie, Department of Joint and \nHand Orthopedics, Hunan University \nof Medicine General Hospital, No. \n144 Jinxi South Road, Huaihua \n418000, Hunan Province, China, Tel: \n17711682556;\nE-mail: xielunli@163.com\nReceived Date: 14 May 2025\nAccepted Date: 29 May 2025\nPublished Date: 30 May 2025\nCitation: \nHong-Xia Zhu BN, Yu Xie, Lei Fu, Lun-\nLi Xie.

Renal osteodystrophy is associated with several orthopedic \nmanifestations, including osteomalacia, avascular necrosis, tendinitis, and pathological fractures \n[2]. Compared with the general population, patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo \nhemodialysis usually develop mineral bone disorders, often resulting in a higher risk of hip \nfractures [3]. The incidence of hip fractures in these patients is 4.4 times higher than that in the \ngeneral population [4]. In addition, patients with renal osteodystrophy have a higher probability \nof mortality and complications than those with osteoporotic hip fractures alone [1,5]. As for the \ntreatment of hip fractures with end-stage renal disease and hemodialysis, hip arthroplasty may be \na primary recommendation based on previously published literature [1,6]. Nevertheless, previous \nstudies on hip fractures associated with end-stage renal disease involved small sample sizes and did \nnot reveal treatment programs in the perioperative period [1,7]. \nOur study aimed to clarify the treatment program for hip fractures in patients with end-stage \nrenal disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis, based on a retrospective analysis."

All patients provided informed \nconsent according to ethical standards. The inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria are listed in Table 1. All patients underwent total hip \nreplacement, hemiarthroplasty, and regular hemodialysis. Data were \ngathered from their records (Table 2) and comprehensive treatment \nalgorithms (Figure 1) were formulated based on multidisciplinary \nteam consultations. \nResults\nAfter reviewing the medical records of our institution, we \nidentified 18 patients with hip fractures and renal osteodystrophy. \nFinally, six patients were included in this study based on the above \ninclusion and exclusion criteria. The relevant medical messages are \nlisted in Tables 2 and 3. The fractures in our group were classified \naccording to radiological data (Figure 2). We promptly performed \na multidisciplinary team consultation to prepare the preoperative \npreparations. A comprehensive treatment program is suggested by a \nmultidisciplinary team, including a plan for hemodialysis, planning \nof anticoagulation and anti-osteoporosis therapy, therapeutic strategy \nfor respiratory or cardiovascular disease and diabetes, therapy for \nhyperparathyroidism, anesthetic program, and plan for postoperative \nrehabilitation (Figure 1). Considering mobility and life expectancy, \nall patients underwent total arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty (Figure \n3). Pathological examination of the femoral head revealed ischemic \nnecrosis and local hemorrhage (Figure 4). None of the patients had \nany complications, such as deep wound infection, postoperative \nhematoma, deep venous thrombosis, sciatic nerve injury, pneumonia, \nor cardiopulmonary arrest. One of the six patients in our study died in \nthe first year after hip fracture surgery and died of a cerebrovascular \naccident 8 months after surgery.\nDiscussion\nCompared to the general population, a higher mortality rate \nhas been confirmed in patients with hip fractures associated with \nend-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis. Among patients \nwith end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis is associated with a 61% \nhigher risk of hip fracture than peritoneal dialysis, which was proven \nby Boonpheng et al. in their meta-analysis of observational studies \non the risk of hip fracture in patients undergoing hemodialysis \nversus peritoneal dialysis [8]. Patients with end-stage renal disease \nwho undergo hemodialysis usually have one or more other \ndiseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary disease, \nhyperparathyroidism, and osteoporosis. These patients have a \nsignificantly higher risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality due \nto multiple co-morbidities, regardless of the type of surgery. Thus, \nin dialysis patients, therapeutic strategies in the perioperative period \n[1,7]. Our study clarified the treatment program of hip fracture in \npatients with end-stage renal disease who were on chronic hemodialysis \nin terms of a retrospective analysis of six subjects based on their \nmedical messages. This comprehensive treatment program consists \nof preoperative treatment, intraoperative management strategies, and \npostoperative therapeutic programs. These comprehensive treatment \nmethods include planned hemodialysis, prophylactic anticoagulation, \nanti-osteoporosis therapy, management of blood pressure and blood \nsugar levels, and treatment of hyperparathyroidism.

Our three patients showed \nabnormal levels of serum potassium, sodium, and calcium even after \nundergoing regular hemodialysis. In fact, the appropriate timing \nof preoperative dialysis remains unclear, owing to the scarcity of \nclinical data. Nevertheless, removal of uremic toxins dependent on \nhemodialysis within 24 h prior to surgery and after the postoperative \ntime can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. A previous study \nreported that a simple scheduling policy for perioperative hemodialysis \nwas effective in reducing both the cost and unnecessary perioperative \nrisks for patients [9]. Renew et al. suggested that hemodialysis within \n24 hours prior to surgery was associated with a lower potassium \nlevel on the day of surgery [10]. Six patients underwent planned \nperioperative dialysis, and no serious complications were observed \nduring the hospital stay. In addition, uremia level, fluid status, and \nelectrolyte level were reasonable after hemodialysis. \nWith regard to prophylactic anticoagulation, a correct assessment \nof the underlying bleeding should be performed, especially for \nearly gastrointestinal bleeding or potential encephalorrhagia. \nUnfractionated heparin is recommended as the first-choice \nanticoagulant for hemodialysis. Notably, low molecular weight \nheparin is not suitable for patients with hip fractures associated with \nend-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis [11,12]. Considering \nthat the heparin effect lasts for 4 h, elective surgery should be \nscheduled for at least 6 h after dialysis to avoid perioperative bleeding \nwhen unfractionated heparin is used during hemodialysis.

One study \nfound that the following factors were associated with low bone mass \nin hemodialysis patients: advanced age, low body weight, low serum \nalbumin levels, and high alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid \nhormone levels [13]. Decreased glomerular filtration often leads to \nundue phosphate retention, causing hyperphosphatemia that results \nin decreasing in 1, 25 di-hydroxy vitamin-D synthesis. Finally, these \nin turn causes hypocalcemia [14]. Simultaneously, higher phosphate \nlevels in the cytoplasm matrix of gastrointestinal cells impede the \nabsorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract, which adds \nto the insult and further exacerbates hypocalcemia. In patients on \ndialysis, inverse hypocalcemia stimulation results in hyperactivity of \nthe parathyroid glands, and hyperphosphatemia directly stimulates \nparathyroid hormone secretion [14,15]. These factors maintain \na persistent stimulus of parathyroid hyperplasia. The resultant \nsecondary hyperparathyroidism tends to compensate for low serum \ncalcium levels by leeching calcium from bones. In our study, four \npatients underwent the parathormone test, and the results showed \nslightly high levels. The overall result of this vicious cycle is that \nthe bone structure, particularly in the vertebrae, pelvis, and neck \nfemur regions, is significantly weakened, rendering it susceptible to \npathological fractures [16]. Thus, in patients with end-stage renal \ndisease requiring calcimimetics, calcitriol, vitamin D analogs, or a \ncombination of calcimimetics with calcitriol or vitamin D analogs has \nbeen suggested [2]. However, a majority of anti-osteoporosis agents \nshould be avoided to use for patients with end-stage renal disease, \nexcept that denosumab due to its action mechanism which is cleared \nby the reticuloendothelial system and not the kidney [17,18].\nIt is extremely important to tailor the blood pressure in patients \nwith end-stage renal disease to reduce perioperative morbidity. \nPatients with end-stage renal disease receive tailored treatment \nof blood pressure, which should be less than 130/80 mmHg, as \nrecommended by the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines [19]. The \nuse of one or more antihypertensive agents, including angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and \ncalcium channel blockers [20].\nHeart failure combined with systolic heart failure and diastolic \nfailure, as the final form of cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal \ndisease patients, needs to be considered by orthopedists. When acute \npulmonary edema or congestion occurs in patients with preserved \nmicturition, a suitable intravenous diuretic should be initially \nadministered by a physician [21]. Systolic blood pressure lies between \n85 mmHg and 115 mmHg. In respectively, continued administration \nof dobutamine or a vasodilator, nitroglycerin is necessarily needed in \npatients with a systolic blood pressure<85 mmHg or a systolic blood \npressure>115 mmHg. Moreover, emergency hemodialysis is required \nwhen the hemodynamics are unstable.\nAsymptomatic or concealed respiratory diseases associated \nwith end-stage renal disease are important, yet under-recognized \nconditions that can lead to life-threatening complications. In \naddition, pneumonia requires the use of sensitive antibiotics and \neffective atomization. Pulmonary hypertension requires therapy \nwith endothelial receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, \nor prostacyclin agonist [22]. It is worth noting that cautious use \nof diuretics is needed, as they lead to dangerous hypotension with \nregard to pulmonary hypertension therapy.\nIn patients with diabetic end-stage renal disease, careful glucose \nmonitoring is important because of the difficulty in predicting \ninsulin requirements and increasing the risk of hypoglycemia [23]. \nIncreased mortality of patients undergoing hemodialysis has been \nreported by Ricks et al. when HbA1c levels were less than 6.0% \nor>8.0% [24]. However, their clinical significance remains unclear. \nThese findings indicate that patients with HbA1c levels<6.0% have \npoor outcomes from the viewpoint of burnout diabetes [25]. Thus, \na target HbA1c range of 6.0%\u20138.0% in patients with end-stage renal \ndisease are recommended, particularly in diabetic dialysis patients \n[26]. As mentioned above, insulin is preferred by most hemodialysis \npatients who require medication, even though oral agents are \nacceptable alternatives. In fact, many diabetes medications, including \nmetformin, are contraindicated if the estimated glomerular filtration \nrate falls below 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m\n2 [27,28].\nEnd-stage renal disease is an independent risk factor for \ncerebrovascular events and increased mortality [29,30]. The incidence \nof ischemic stroke in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing \nhemodialysis is 2.5-fold higher than that in age- and sex-matched \ncontrols in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis [31]. \nAntiplatelet agents have not shown a clear benefit in secondary stroke \nprevention, but aspirin may reduce the incidence of stroke in patients \nwith hypertensive end-stage renal disease. Observational data suggest \nFigure 4: The pathological results of femoral head in patient with end-stage renal disease combined with hemodialysis\nThe pathological results of femoral head in patient with end-stage renal disease combined with hemodialysis. a and b: Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, magnification \n40\u2019:The phenomenons of ischemic necrosis of head and manifestations of local hemorrhage."

These patients are at high risk of cerebrovascular \nmorbidity and mortality. However, despite being well tolerated, statin \ntherapy evaluated in large clinical trials in this patient population has \ngenerally failed to significantly reduce the disease burden. The cause \nof cerebrovascular death is not always atherosclerotic in nature and \nmay depend on the modality of renal replacement therapy [33]. In \nour study, all patients regularly received oral statin therapy because \nof plaques in the carotid artery. \nAs a commonly diagnosed complication among patients with \nend-stage renal disease who are undergoing hemodialysis, anemia \nshould be treated as soon as possible; if not, it may affect the patient\u2019s \nquality of life. Several causes of anemia have been reported in these \npopulations, including iron deficiency, iron utilization, and dietary \nrestrictions [34]. Thus, the therapeutic protocol for anemia consists of \nadditional infusion of iron, recombinant human erythropoietin, and \nred blood cell transfusions. Finally, any patient will eventually require \ntreatment with erythropoietin or similar products administered by \ninjection. The need for red blood cell transfusion remains for patients \nwho require an immediate increase in their red blood cell mass due to \nsymptomatic anemia or hip replacement surgery. Caution regarding \nhyperkalemia or transfusion-associated circulatory overload occurs \nin patients with end-stage renal disease. On perioperative duration, in \nfact, strategy to prevent post-transfusion hyperkalemia or circulatory \noverload is accepted planed hemodialysis [35].\nConclusion\nThese comprehensive treatment methods include planned \nhemodialysis, prophylactic anticoagulation, anti-osteoporosis \ntherapy, management of blood pressure and blood sugar levels, \nand treatment of hyperparathyroidism. In addition, respiratory \ndisease, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and renal anemia \nshould be considered effective therapies. Unfractionated heparin is \nrecommended as the first-choice anticoagulant for these patients \nbecause low-molecular-weight heparin may increase the risk of \nhemorrhage. Planned hemodialysis within 24 h prior to surgery \nand after surgery can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. \nAvoiding the use of a majority of anti-osteoporosis agents for these \npatients, except for denosumab, owing to its mechanism of action, \nwhich is cleared by the reticuloendothelial system and not the kidney. \nWe suggest that calcimimetics, calcitriol, vitamin D analogs, or a \ncombination of calcimimetics with calcitriol or vitamin D analogs \nbe used for these patients. A target HbA1c range of 6.0%\u20138.0% in \npatients with end-stage renal disease is recommended for diabetic \ndialysis patients. It is worth noting that cautious use of diuretics \nis needed, as they lead to dangerous hypotension with regard to \npulmonary hypertension therapy.

Her diabetes was controlled on insulin throughout her12 ante-\nnatal visits. On examination she was healthy-looking with normal vital signs and a midline infra \numbilical scar; compactible fundal height of a singleton foetus with heart rate of 148 bpm. \nShe had elective caesarean section with findings of dense pelvic adhesions, a partial rupture of the \nanterior uterine wall and a live female foetus with a birth weight of 2.5kg, good Apgar scores; and \nestimated blood loss of 1.5litre. Three units of blood were transfused intra-operatively. \nShe was noticed to be bleeding per vagina with a non-contracting uterus despite oxytocin infusion. \nImmediately re-explored, subtotal hysterectomy done but haemostasis was unsuccessful despite \nmultidisciplinary team approach. Abdomen was packed and closed. She had 12 units of blood, 2 \nunits of fresh frozen plasma transfused and admitted to the intensive care unit. \nAt the second-look surgery 72 hours later, packs were removed and haemostasis was satisfactory \nwith a healthy-looking bowel. The abdomen was closed and patient recovered to intensive Care \nUnit. She responded well, was discharged on the 12th day post-operative (PCV=31%) after 19 units \nof blood and 2 units of FFP transfusion. \nIn conclusion,severe postpartum haemorrhage from dense adhesions of previous abdominal \nsurgeries in caesarean section is life-threatening. Our experience showed that available blood \ntransfusion and intensive care services; and early triger of multidisciplinary care are key to a \nsuccessful outcome.\nKeywords: Difficult Caesarean section; multiple transfusions; abdominal packing; second look \nsurgery; Near-miss\nLiman Idris M1*, Bello S1, Babandi Rukayya M1, Durojaiye Korede W1, Oladepo Suleiman O1, \nOkoye Uchenna E1 and Ya\u2019u Gagarawa A2\n1Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, National Hospital Abuja (NHA), Nigeria\n2Department of Surgery, National Hospital Abuja (NHA), Nigeria\nOPEN ACCESS\n*Correspondence:\nLiman Idris M, Department of Obstetrics \nand Gynaecology\n, National Hospital \nAbuja, P.

A loss of these amounts within 24 hours of delivery is termed \nearly or primary PPH, whereas such losses are termed late or secondary PPH if they occur 24 hours \nafter delivery [1,2]. According to the WHO, each year, about 14 million women experience PPH \nresulting in about 70,000 maternal deaths globally [3]. \nThe majority of maternal deaths due to PPH occur in sub-Saharan Africa due to the increased \nprevalence of risk factors and poorly developed obstetrics services, [4-6].  These maternal deaths \ncome with both significant economic losses to the family and society as well as a negative impact on \nthe health of the surviving children [5]. In Nigeria, there is a significant variation in PPH rates with \na range of 0.4 \u2013 16.8% with a considerable variation in maternal outcome as well [7]. \nAlthough uterine atony is the most common cause of primary PPH, the bleeding is more likely"

The outcome is a \nlive female baby. She is three years now.\nShe is a known diabetic diagnosed about a year prior to \npresentation, well controlled and on Humalog insulin 12:12:8. She \nwas not a known hypertensive and had no known drug allergies. \nShe had 5 abdominal surgeries as follows; 3 open myomectomies, 1 \nprevious caesarian section and 1 open appendectomy.\nExamination revealed a calm woman in no obvious distress. She \nwas afebrile (36\n0C), not pale with no pedal oedema. Her pulse rate \nwas 76 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 110/69mmHg. Her \nchest was clinically clear and the abdomen was gravid with a midline \ninfra-umbilical scar. Fundal height was 36cm above symphysis with \na singleton foetus, longitudinal lie, cephalic presenting and a regular \nfetal heart rate of 148bpm. \nShe was worked up for surgery in conjunction with the \nneonatologists, anaesthetists and endocrinologists. Three units of \nblood were cross matched. Blood investigations were within normal \nlimits with a PCV of 30%. Her latest obstetrics ultrasound showed no \nfoetal abnormalities. \nShe had the elective caesarean section under subarachnoid block. \nIntra-operative findings were dense pelvic adhesions involving the \nrectus sheath and the anterior lower uterine segment with a partial \nrupture of anterior uterine wall. A live female neonate was delivered \ncephalic with a birth weight of 2.5kg, Apgar scores of 8, 9, 9 in the 1\nst, \n5th and 10th minutes respectively; and placenta was anterior. Estimated \nblood loss was 1.5litres and 3 units of blood were transfused intra \noperatively. \nThirty minutes postoperatively, she was noticed to be bleeding per \nvagina with a flabby uterus that responded poorly to uterine massage \ndespite on-going oxytocin infusion. Patient and her spouse were \ncounselled and high-risk consent obtained for possible hysterectomy. \nShe was immediately re-explored and the findings were; a flabby \nuterus, blood oozing in the pelvis, freed bowel surfaces as well as \nresidual dense adhesions. Subtotal hysterectomy was done but \nbleeding continued, then General surgical and urological teams were \ninvited. When all attempts at securing haemostasis proved abortive, \nabdominopelvic packing and temporary abdominal wall closure were \ndone. The estimated blood loss was 3.1 litres. She received an additional \n12 units of O-positive blood under frusemide cover, 10mls of 10% \ncalcium gluconate was given for every 3 units of blood transfused. She \nhad 2 units of fresh frozen plasmas transfused and was commenced \non parenteral antibiotics (Ceftriazone and Metronidazole) and \nanalgesics (Pentazocine). She was then admitted to intensive care \nunit on inotropes and oxygen. In between blood transfusions, she was \nmaintained on normal saline and 5% dextrose in water solution. The \npatient was monitored in conjunction with surgeons, anaesthetists \nand haematologists in the ICU for 72 hours. Clotting profile showed \nprothrombin time (PT) of 12.5, activated partial thromboplastin time \n(APTT) of 39.1 and International Normalize Ratio (INR) of 1.21, and \nwas assessed as essentially normal. She had one unit of fresh whole \nblood transfused while in the ICU, and intravenous ceftriaxone was \nchanged to Meropenem and Metronidazole. She was continued on \nparenteral Pentazocine and Paracetamol. \nShe had a second look surgery with the removal of the abdominal \npacks on the third day. Haemostasis was satisfactory and her \nbowels were healthy-looking. Two additional units of blood were \ntransfused intraoperatively. The abdominal wall was closed, and she \nwas monitored in ICU for another 48 hours; had one unit of blood \ntransfused before she was transferred to the ward.  \nShe recovered well and was discharged on the 12\nth day post-\noperative after 19 units of blood transfusion and 2 units of FFP. The \nPCV at discharge was 31%. She was seen two weeks at follow up clinic \nand found to be well with no complaints. Her PCV was 32%.\nDiscussion\nThe patient was 46 years old para 1+0, a known diabetic with IVF-\nconceived singleton gestation and a history of multiple abdominal \nsurgeries. Although the effect of maternal age has not been clearly \ndefined in a large study, increasing maternal age of 35 years and \nabove is associated with a higher risk of PPH [11]. This may be due \nto the increased risk of comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes \nmellitus as seen in our case. Our patient booked at 10 weeks of \ngestation in line with early booking seen in patients with high-risk \npregnancies for close specialist attention throughout pregnancy. \nFurthermore, she was educated and gainfully employed. A study from \nTanzania found that maternal level of education and economic status \nas factors associated with early booking [12]. She was compliant as \nseen in her recorded twelve antenatal visits. \nOur patient developed postpartum haemorrhage within 30 \nminutes of caesarean delivery. This is in line with several studies \nindicating the onset of PPH within the first few hours of caesarean \nsection [8, 9, 13]. The intraoperative finding of a flabby uterus indicated \nuterine atony as the primary culprit. Uterine atony has widely been \nproven to be the most common cause of primary PPH in many series \n[3, 9, 14, 15]. This differs from some isolated studies conducted in \nsouthwest Nigeria where retained products of conception was found \nto account for up to 71% of cases of primary PPH [16]. Subtotal \nhysterectomy was done simultaneously with resuscitation using \nblood and inotropic support. This became necessary when all other \navailable non-operative and less invasive methods failed to stop \nthe bleeding. Although hysterectomy for PPH is not common, it is \nsometimes the only option left in our setting. Studies in the United"

This is quite high and reflects the severity \nof the PPH from a recalcitrant atony; and severe adhesions from \nmultiple previous abdominal surgeries. This large volume of blood \ntransfusion in PPH may be isolated and uncommon at the in the \ncontemporary practice. In fact, it has been observed to be on the \ndecline in recent years as shown by nationwide comparison at two \ndifferent times [19]. In general, blood requirements in PPH vary with \nseverity. In Nigeria, while there is a high rate of blood transfusion \nin some facilities, blood transfusion requirement of 0.4 to 48.6% was \nrecorded in a multicenter study involving 38 health facilities [7].\nThis patient had initial temporary abdominal closure followed \nby intensive care admission for continued resuscitation and \nmonitoring; and final re-exploration with definitive abdominal wall \nclosure. The decision for pelvic packing/ damage control was taken \nwhen there were still some oozing areas in the pelvis following \nsubtotal hysterectomy. This is appropriate in this patient who had \nreceived a massive transfusion and was at risk of coagulopathy from \na combination of factors. Damage control surgery, though rare \nhas been described in postpartum haemorrhage [20]. In addition, \nintensive care was employed as part of the damage control surgery \nand for further resuscitation and monitoring in patients with severe \nhaemorrhage as in our case. \nPatient had a satisfactory recovery and was discharged on the 12\nth \nday from the first surgery. Despite the additional morbidity and a \nprolonged hospital stay, it is a success story of an African woman with \na massive haemorrhage. This success was possible partly due to the \navailability of blood, an intensive care facility and a multidisciplinary \nteam which were timely mobilised for the total care of this patient. \nConclusion\nMassive postpartum haemorrhage may follow a caesarean \ndelivery in a patient with previous multiple uterine surgeries. Our \nexperience shows that the availability of blood transfusion facilities, \nintensive care and early trigger and mobilisation of relevant teams are \nkey to a successful outcome.\nReferences\n1.

While the symptom itself may result from benign conditions, studies \nindicate that postcoital bleeding is the presenting complaint in approximately 11% of women \ndiagnosed with cervical cancer [2]. Cervical cancer, predominantly caused by human papillomavirus \n(HPV) infection, is one of the most common cancers among women globally, yet it remains highly \npreventable and curable in its early stages [3]. Early sexual debut, multiple sexual partners, smoking, \nand low socioeconomic status increase the likelihood of women in lower- and middle-income \ncountries of developing this disease [3,4]. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, particularly in cases \nwith overlapping symptoms such as cervical myoma, poses a significant challenge, complicating \neffective management and treatment outcomes [5]. Cervical myomas are benign tumors that can \npresent with symptoms similar to those of cervical cancer, including abnormal bleeding and pain \nduring intercourse [5].\nCase Presentation\nA 29-year-old woman of West-African descent with no known chronic illness presented with \na one-year history of intermittent post-coital bleeding and yellowish-colored vaginal discharge. \nThe symptoms worsened over time. She first sought care at a private hospital in Accra (the capital \ncity), where a pelvic ultrasound revealed uterine fibroids and a lesion near her cervix. She was \nsubsequently referred to 37 Military Hospital in Accra. However, attempts to perform a speculum \nexamination and subsequent Pap smear or cervical biopsy on two occasions were unsuccessful due \nto lack of co-operation from the patient.\nFollowing this, she relocated to Kumasi (the second largest city in Ghana) and sought treatment \nfrom an herbal practitioner (Medimafo Herbal), where she was placed on herbal medications for \nsix months. During this period, repeated pelvic ultrasounds (at private ultra-sonography set ups)"

A nurse friend of the patient referred her to Divine \nHealthcare for a myomectomy (a private health facility). During the \nsurgery, the clinician noted that the mass appeared cancerous and \ndid not resemble a typical myoma (obviously, a thorough pelvic \nexamination was not done before the laparotomy). Some uterine \ntissues were excised, yet histopathology could not be conducted as \ninstructed by clinician due to miscommunication between the health \nfacility and relatives of the patient. The specimen was eventually \ndiscarded per the hospital records.\nHer bleeding persisted, and she experienced prolonged wound \nhealing following the surgery. She received four units of blood \ntransfusions for anemia but noted no significant improvement. A \nfollow-up pelvic ultrasound revealed a persistent uterine mass. She \nwas initially referred to Komfo Anokye Teaching hospital (KATH) \nwhich is the second largest tertiary institution in the country and the \nonly tertiary institution in Kumasi. She however decided to seek care \nat a district hospital (a secondary level of healthcare) due to financial \nconstraints and unfriendly environment at the tertiary institution. A \nmidwife who knew her sister advised them to see a gynaecologist at \nSuntreso government hospital (a secondary level of healthcare). She \npresented to the facility with bleeding per vaginam and severe anemia.\nThe patient reported with significant weight loss, easy fatigability, \npalpitations, dizziness, night sweats, lower abdominal pain, and lower \nback pain. She had no fever, lymphadenopathy, or other systemic \nsymptoms.\nShe was parity 1, had the child at 19 years old. Menarche \noccurred at age 14. She had a regular 30-day menstrual cycle with \nblood flow of 4-5 days till onset of abnormal vaginal bleeding. She \nhad no dysmenorrhea. There was no history of cervical screening for \npremalignant cervical lesions. She had never had breast screening \neven though she was aware of these programs. She had on some \noccasions resorted to Emergency contraceptive pills (progesterone \nbased) for prevention of unintended pregnancies.\nShe had her first sexual intercourse at age 15. She had had about \n15 sexual partners with inconsistent condom use. She had no known \nchronic medical conditions such as Human Immunodeficiency \nSyndrome (HIV), diabetes or sickle cell disease.\nThe patient is a medical counter assistant (dispenses medications \nin a pharmacy) and is single. She lived with her mother at the time \nof her diagnosis. She reported occasional smoking, having first tried \nsmoking at age 25, with an average of 1\u20132 cigarette pack per year. She \nconsumes alcohol occasionally, preferring Smirnoff (approximately \ntwo bottles on social occasions).\nExamination findings showed a patient in severe pain; rating it \nat 9/10 on the pain scale. She was very pale, moderately hydrated, \nand not in respiratory distress. She was conscious and alert, with a \nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15/15.\nAbdominal examination revealed a widespread rigidity and \ntender hard mass in the suprapubic region extending into both iliac \nfossae. The edge of the mass was not well defined and was immobile \nin both transverse and horizontal planes.\nPelvic exam revealed a cervical mass involving parts of the vagina. \nThe mass bled on contact. The severe pain necessitated examination \nunder anaesthesia (EUA).\nDuring EUA, an exophytic cervical lesion extending into the \nlower third of the vagina was noticed.  Clinical staging was done \n(Stage III B). Biopsy was taken for histopathological report.\nShe had hemoglobin (HB) level of 4.3g/dl. HIV test was negative. \nClient received 5 units of blood while on the ward. Her post \ntransfusion HB was 10.2g/dl. The histopathology report indicated \ninvasive squamous cell carcinoma, non-keratinizing type and poorly \ndifferentiated. \nThe patient was stabilized and was referred to the oncology unit of \nKATH. She underwent further investigations and the clinical staging \nwas upgraded to Stage IV A.\nAt the oncology unit, she was supposed to undergo chemo-\nradiation, but the Linear accelerator (LINAC) machine for radiation \nwas faulty and thus could not benefit from radiation even though \nradiation was the main stay of treatment. It was the only unit with \nLINAC in the middle and northern part of the country. Therefore, \nmost of the patients were transferred to Korle Bu Teaching Hospital \nin Accra for radiation as the machine was being serviced. Fixing \nthe LINAC took 12 months. The patient however did not have the \nfinancial means to travel to Accra for the treatment. \nShe was supposed to receive about 4 cycles of induction \nchemotherapy prior to definitive chemotherapy. \nThe treatment delayed for about 2 months because she developed \nobstructive uropathy that required a bypass with nephrostomy tube. \nShe also developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left lower \nlimb and was placed on Rivaroxaban (Xarelto). She also received \nmultiple hemotransfusions for the correction of her anaemia.\nWhen she became stable, she received one cycle of induction \nchemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel combination.\nHer hemoglobin levels dropped again and had to suspend the \nchemotherapy for haemotransfusion and stabilization of her vitals. \nHer treatment was also hampered by repeated financial constraints \nas she had to depend on donors for her blood transfusions and \nmedical costs (most of the healthcare costs at the oncology unit are \nnot covered by the National Health Insurance). She was last seen at \nthe oncology unit (KATH) on 6\nth April, 2024. After contacting the \nfamily initially, the patient was being hemotransfused in a nearby \nhealth facility due to low hemoglobin levels and general weakness. \nHer family was contacted again and the medical team was informed \nshe had passed on 4 months after the last visit to the oncology unit.\nDiscussion\nPostcoital bleeding is a significant gynecological symptom that \noften raises concerns about underlying malignancy, particularly \ncervical cancer [6]. It is known that cervical cancer may present \nwith minimal or no symptoms in its early stages, which makes early \ndetection challenging [2]. As highlighted in the case of the 29-year-\nold woman, persistent postcoital bleeding and yellow-colored vaginal \ndischarge led her to seek multiple medical consultations before \na proper diagnosis could be made. The gradual worsening of her \nsymptoms, including the unhealed surgical wound and persistent \nmass, likely signaled an underlying malignancy, despite initial \ndiagnoses pointing toward benign uterine fibroids.\nThe health seeking behaviour of the patient was also not ideal as \nshe did not respond and sometimes delayed response to healthcare. \nShe also resorted to herbal treatments that has not been scientifically \nproven. Poor adherence to diagnosis and treatment, resorting to"

Provider related barriers to cervical cancer treatment \ninclude inadequate training of healthcare workers, poor quality of \ncare (poor counselling on the part of clinicians in this case), limited \naccess to diagnostic and treatment infrastructure [11].\nCervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in \nwomen worldwide, with postcoital bleeding being one of the common \npresenting symptoms [7]. Tarney and Han (2014) noted that postcoital \nbleeding is often the first symptom that prompts patients to seek care, \nraising the suspicion of cervical cancer (1). Although risk factors such \nas smoking, immunosuppression, and sexually transmitted infections \nhave been linked to the development of cervical cancer (3,4), they are \nnot always present in every case. In the case presented, the patient\u2019s \nhistory of multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use is \na relevant risk factor, as HPV infection, a major cause of cervical \ncancer, can be transmitted through sexual activity [3,8].\nThe diagnostic challenges faced by the patient underscore the \nimportance of timely and accurate diagnostic procedures. Despite \npresenting with alarming symptoms, the patient initially received \ntreatments aimed at fibroids (probably due to her young age), \nwhich are more commonly diagnosed than cervical cancer in cases \nof abnormal uterine bleeding [5]. The delay in conducting a Pap \nsmear (or biopsy), due to active vaginal bleeding, and the reliance \non ultrasounds for diagnosis also highlight the limitations of imaging \ntechniques in identifying cervical cancer. While pelvic ultrasound is \nuseful in identifying masses, it cannot reliably differentiate between \nbenign and malignant tumors [9].\nThe case also draws attention to the common misdiagnosis of \ncervical cancer as a benign myoma. This overlap can complicate \nmanagement, as cervical myomas and cervical cancer may share \nsimilar clinical manifestations, including vaginal bleeding and the \npresence of masses [5]. As demonstrated in the case of a 48-year-\nold woman whose cervical cancer was initially mistaken for a \ncervical myoma [5], a histopathological examination is essential \nfor differentiating between these two conditions. In the presented \ncase, the mass could have been more thoroughly investigated earlier \nwith a biopsy, allowing for an earlier diagnosis and a more targeted \ntreatment approach.\nMoreover, the persistence of symptoms despite treatment with \nherbal medicine and blood transfusions for anemia raises questions \nabout the effectiveness of alternative treatments in managing \ngynecological cancers. While alternative therapies are commonly \nsought by patients, especially in resource-limited settings, there is \nlittle evidence to support their efficacy in treating malignancies such \nas cervical cancer [5]. \nThe prolonged reliance on herbal treatments likely delayed the \npatient\u2019s access to effective medical interventions, which could have \nalleviated symptoms and potentially improved her prognosis.\nThe importance of early screening and intervention cannot be \noverstated. Routine Pap smears and HPV testing are critical for early \ndetection of cervical abnormalities that may progress to cancer [2,3]. \nUnfortunately, women, particularly those in low socioeconomic \nsettings, often lack access to these screening services, which \ncontributes to the late-stage diagnoses of cervical cancer (3). The \npatient\u2019s case reflects the challenges faced by many women, especially \nin regions where access to healthcare and cancer screening is limited.\nReview of Articles\n1. Tarney & Han (2014) [1]: Post-coital bleeding is a common \ncomplaint that can be an early sign of cervical cancer, occurring in 11% \nof cases. Other risk factors include smoking and immunosuppression. \nEarly diagnosis is critical to effective management.\n2. Shapley et al. (2006) [2]: Post-coital bleeding may indicate \ncervical cancer, but the disease is often asymptomatic in its early \nstages, which complicates early detection.\n3. Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention (2004) [4]: Risk \nfactors for HPV infection, such as early sexual debut, multiple sexual \npartners, and smoking, increase the likelihood of cervical cancer. HPV \nis the primary cause, and regular screening is crucial for prevention.\n4. Oktay et al. (2024) [9]: A 37-year-old woman with post-\ncoital bleeding was diagnosed with cervical cancer despite a normal \nPap smear two years earlier. The case highlights the need for ongoing \nscreenings and timely imaging.\n5. Kashyap et al. (2019) [3]: Risk factors for cervical cancer \ninclude HPV, smoking, and early sexual activity. Women with \nlow socioeconomic status often face barriers to screening, which \ncontributes to higher rates of undiagnosed cervical cancer.\n6. Yu et al. (2024) [10]: A 39-year-old woman with persistent \nvaginal bleeding was diagnosed with HPV-related cervical cancer. \nThe case emphasizes the importance of appropriate staging and \nmonitoring after treatment to prevent recurrence.\n7. Benlghazi et al. (2023) [5]: A 48-year-old woman was \nmisdiagnosed with a cervical myoma due to similar symptoms. Later, \nshe was diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer. This highlights the \nneed for thorough diagnostic evaluation to avoid misdiagnosis and \nensure timely treatment.\n8. Tjokroprawiro et al. (2025) [8]: The challenging journey \nof cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment. This study reveals that the \nmajority of presentations with advanced cervical cancer have never \nhad screening for premalignant lesions. It also highlights delays to \ntreatment and poor outcome of treatment due to these delays.\nConclusion\nThis case emphasizes the critical importance of early and accurate \ndiagnosis in the management of postcoital bleeding, particularly in \nidentifying underlying malignancies such as cervical cancer. Taking \ntime to counsel patient on their conditions, the need for timely \nintervention and possible complications of delayed interventions \nshould be well considered by clinicians. The overlap in symptoms \nbetween benign conditions like uterine myomas and cervical cancer \ncan complicate diagnosis, leading to delays in treatment. Timely use \nof screening methods, such as Pap smears and biopsies, alongside \na thorough clinical evaluation, is essential for early detection and \nimproved patient outcomes. Additionally, addressing gaps in \nhealthcare access and promoting routine screening are vital steps \ntoward reducing the burden of cervical cancer, particularly in \nresource-limited settings. \nDeclarations\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to the healthcare staff and management \nmembers of Suntreso government health hospital and Komfo Anokye \nTeaching Hospital, Kumasi."

The majority of HCC cases occur in patients \nwith underlying liver cirrhosis, typically due to chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection, alcohol \nabuse, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [2]. However, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-\nHCC) is a rare variant of HCC that differs from the typical HCC in several aspects.\nFL-HCC was first described in 1956 by Edmondson [3]. It is characterized by the presence of \nneoplastic hepatocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, arranged in \nnests or trabeculae, and separated by dense collagenous stroma [4]. Unlike conventional HCC, FL-\nHCC often affects young individuals, with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of \nlife [5]. Moreover, FL-HCC is less commonly associated with underlying liver disease or cirrhosis, \nalthough some cases may have co-existing risk factors such as a history of exposure to certain toxins \nor genetic syndromes [6].\nThe clinical presentation of FL-HCC is similar to that of other liver tumors, with patients often \npresenting with abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, or non-specific symptoms such as \nfatigue, weight loss, and anorexia [7]. Due to its rarity and distinct characteristics, the diagnosis of \nFL-HCC can be challenging, and it may require a combination of imaging studies, laboratory tests, \nand histological examination for confirmation.\nThe treatment of FL-HCC is primarily surgical, with resection being the mainstay of curative \ntherapy. However, the optimal management strategy for FL-HCC remains controversial, as \nits biological behavior and response to treatment may differ from that of conventional HCC. \nAdditionally, the prognosis of FL-HCC is variable, with some studies suggesting a more favorable \noutcome compared to conventional HCC, while others report similar or even worse survival rates \n[8].\nThis case report presents a young adult with FL-HCC, highlighting the diagnostic and \ntherapeutic challenges encountered and providing a comprehensive review of the current literature \non this rare tumor.\nCase Presentation\nPatient history\nA 25-year-old female with no significant past medical history, family history of cancer, or history \nof alcohol, tobacco, or drug use presented to the emergency department with a two-week history"

The pain was \ndescribed as dull, aching, and non-radiating, and it was not associated \nwith nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever. The patient had noticed a \nrecent decrease in her appetite and a 5-pound weight loss over the \npast month.\nPhysical examination\nOn physical examination, the patient was afebrile, with a blood \npressure of 120/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and a \nrespiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. She appeared well-nourished \nbut slightly pale. The abdominal examination revealed tenderness in \nthe right upper quadrant, with a palpable mass approximately 8 cm \nin diameter. The mass was firm, non-tender, and fixed. There was no \nevidence of jaundice, ascites, or hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder \nof the physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory investigations\nInitial laboratory tests showed a normal complete blood count, \nexcept for a mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL. The \nliver function tests were abnormal, with an elevated aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) of 120 U/L (normal range: 10-40 U/L), an \nelevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 150 U/L (normal range: \n7-56 U/L), and a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 200 \nU/L (normal range: 45-115 U/L). The total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, \nand albumin levels were within normal limits. The serum alpha-\nfetoprotein (AFP) level, a tumor marker commonly associated with \nHCC, was normal at 5 ng/mL (normal range: < 20 ng/mL).\nImaging studies\nA contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of \nthe abdomen and pelvis was performed, which revealed a large, \nwell-defined, heterogeneous mass measuring approximately 10 \ncm in diameter in the right hepatic lobe. The mass showed arterial \nenhancement with washout in the portal venous and delayed phases, \nconsistent with a hypervascular liver tumor (Figure 1). There was \nno evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic metastases, portal vein \nthrombosis, or ascites.\n[Insert Figure 1 here: Contrast-enhanced CT scan showing a \nlarge, well-defined, heterogeneous mass in the right hepatic lobe with \narterial enhancement (arrow) and washout in the portal venous and \ndelayed phases.]\nSubsequently, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of \nthe liver was obtained for further characterization of the mass. \nThe MRI demonstrated a T1-weighted hypointense mass with \nareas of hyperintensity, consistent with hemorrhage or necrosis. \nOn T2-weighted images, the mass was hyperintense, and it \nshowed enhancement on gadoxetic acid-enhanced images, with \na characteristic \"fibrous capsule\" appearance (Figure 2). The MRI \nfindings were highly suggestive of FL-HCC.\n[Insert Figure 2 here: MRI scan showing a T1-weighted \nhypointense mass with areas of hyperintensity (arrow) on T1-\nweighted image (A), hyperintense mass on T2-weighted image (B), \nand enhancement with a characteristic \"fibrous capsule\" appearance \non gadoxetic acid-enhanced image (C).]\nHistopathological examination\nBased on the imaging findings, a percutaneous liver biopsy was \nperformed under ultrasound guidance. The histological examination \nof the biopsy specimen revealed neoplastic hepatocytes with abundant \neosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, arranged in nests \nand trabeculae, and separated by dense collagenous stroma (Figure \n3). Immunohistochemical staining showed positive expression of \nhepatocyte-specific antigen (HepPar-1), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), and \nepithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and negative expression of AFP, \nCD34, and desmin. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis \nof FL-HCC.\n[Insert Figure 3 here: Histopathological examination of the liver \nbiopsy specimen showing neoplastic hepatocytes with abundant \neosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli (arrow) arranged \nin nests and trabeculae, separated by dense collagenous stroma \n(Hematoxylin and Eosin stain, original magnification x200).]\nTreatment and follow-up\nThe patient was referred to the hepatobiliary surgery department \nfor further management. Given the size and location of the tumor, a \nright hepatectomy was planned. The patient underwent a successful \nright hepatectomy, and the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis \nof FL-HCC with negative surgical margins.\nPostoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery and was \ndischarged home on the fifth postoperative day. She was followed \nup regularly with physical examinations, laboratory tests, and \nimaging studies. At the six-month follow-up, there was no evidence \nof recurrence or metastasis. The patient's liver function tests had \nreturned to normal, and she reported feeling well.\nLiterature Review\nEpidemiology\nFL-HCC is a rare tumor, accounting for approximately 1-2% \nof all HCC cases [9]. It has a distinct age and gender distribution \ncompared to conventional HCC. While conventional HCC typically \naffects older individuals with underlying liver disease, FL-HCC often \npresents in young adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 25-30 \nyears [5]. There is no significant gender predilection, with a male-to-\nfemale ratio of approximately 1:1 [10].\nThe incidence of FL-HCC is relatively low worldwide, but it has \nbeen reported to be more common in certain regions, such as North \nAmerica and Europe [11]. The reasons for this geographical variation \nare not well understood, but it may be related to differences in \nenvironmental factors, genetic background, or diagnostic practices.\nPathogenesis\nThe exact pathogenesis of FL-HCC remains unclear. Unlike \nconventional HCC, which is strongly associated with chronic liver \ninjury and cirrhosis, FL-HCC is often found in patients without \nunderlying liver disease. However, some studies have suggested that \ncertain risk factors may be associated with the development of FL-\nHCC, including exposure to certain toxins, such as aflatoxin B1, and \ngenetic syndromes, such as hereditary hemochromatosis and Li-\nFraumeni syndrome [6].\nRecent molecular studies have identified several genetic and \nepigenetic alterations in FL-HCC. These include mutations in genes \nsuch as CTNNB1, TP53, and ARID1A, as well as alterations in the \nexpression of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs [12]. However, \nthe role of these molecular alterations in the pathogenesis of FL-\nHCC is still being investigated, and more research is needed to fully \nunderstand the underlying mechanisms.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of FL-HCC can be challenging, as its clinical and"

The \ntypical presentation of FL-HCC is a young adult with abdominal pain \nor a palpable abdominal mass. Laboratory tests may show abnormal \nliver function tests, but the serum AFP level is usually normal, which \ndifferentiates FL-HCC from conventional HCC, in which AFP is \noften elevated.\nImaging studies play a crucial role in the diagnosis of FL-HCC. \nContrast-enhanced CT and MRI are the most commonly used \nimaging modalities, and they can provide important information \nabout the size, location, and characteristics of the tumor. FL-HCC \ntypically appears as a large, well-defined, heterogeneous mass with \narterial enhancement and washout in the portal venous and delayed \nphases on CT and MRI. The presence of a \"fibrous capsule\" or central \nscar on imaging is also a characteristic feature of FL-HCC [13].\nHistopathological examination of a biopsy specimen is required \nfor a definitive diagnosis of FL-HCC. The histological features of \nFL-HCC include neoplastic hepatocytes with abundant eosinophilic \ncytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, arranged in nests or trabeculae, \nand separated by dense collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemical \nstaining can help to confirm the diagnosis, with positive expression \nof HepPar-1, CK7, and EMA, and negative expression of AFP being \ncharacteristic of FL-HCC [4].\nTreatment\nThe mainstay of treatment for FL-HCC is surgical resection, \nwith curative intent. Complete resection of the tumor with negative \nsurgical margins is associated with the best prognosis. However, due \nto the large size and location of the tumor at the time of diagnosis, \nonly a small percentage of patients with FL-HCC are eligible for \nsurgical resection [14].\nIn patients who are not candidates for surgical resection, other \ntreatment options may be considered, including liver transplantation, \nablation therapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and \nsystemic chemotherapy. Liver transplantation may be an option for \nselected patients with FL-HCC, especially those with tumors that are \nnot resectable but are confined to the liver [15]. Ablation therapy, \nsuch as radiofrequency ablation or microwave ablation, can be \nused to treat small FL-HCC tumors, especially in patients who are \nnot suitable for surgery. TACE is a palliative treatment option that \ncan be used to reduce the size of the tumor and relieve symptoms \nin patients with unresectable FL-HCC. Systemic chemotherapy has \nshown limited efficacy in the treatment of FL-HCC, and its role in the \nmanagement of this disease is still being investigated [16].\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis of FL-HCC is variable, and it depends on several \nfactors, including the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, the \ntreatment modality used, and the presence of underlying liver disease. \nIn general, patients with FL-HCC who undergo complete surgical \nresection have a better prognosis compared to those who do not. \nThe reported 5-year survival rates for patients with resected FL-HCC \nrange from 30% to 70% [8].\nHowever, some studies have suggested that FL-HCC may have a \nmore aggressive biological behavior and a worse prognosis compared \nto conventional HCC, especially in patients with advanced disease \nor those with certain molecular alterations [17]. Additionally, the \nrecurrence rate of FL-HCC after surgical resection is relatively high, \nand long-term follow-up is essential to detect and treat recurrence \nearly.\nDiscussion\nThis case report describes a rare case of FL-HCC in a young \nadult with no significant medical history. The patient presented \nwith abdominal pain, and the diagnosis was established through a \ncombination of imaging studies, laboratory tests, and histological \nexamination. The patient underwent a successful right hepatectomy, \nand she had an uneventful recovery with no evidence of recurrence at \nthe six-month follow-up.\nFL-HCC is a distinct histological subtype of HCC that requires a \nhigh index of suspicion for early diagnosis. The typical presentation of \nFL-HCC in a young adult without underlying liver disease, along with \nthe characteristic imaging and histological features, should prompt \nthe clinician to consider this diagnosis. The normal serum AFP level \nin this case was also a useful diagnostic clue, as AFP is usually elevated \nin conventional HCC.\nThe treatment of FL-HCC is primarily surgical, and complete \nresection of the tumor with negative surgical margins is the goal \nof therapy. In this case, the patient was fortunate to be eligible for \nsurgical resection, which provided her with the best chance of cure. \nHowever, it is important to note that the prognosis of FL-HCC is \nvariable, and long-term follow-up is essential to detect and treat \nrecurrence early.\nThis case report also highlights the importance of a \ncomprehensive literature review in understanding rare diseases. \nBy reviewing the current literature on FL-HCC, we were able to \ngain a better understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, \ndiagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this disease. This knowledge \ncan help clinicians to make more informed decisions regarding the \nmanagement of patients with FL-HCC.\nIn conclusion, FL-HCC is a rare but important subtype of HCC \nthat requires early recognition and appropriate management. This \ncase report contributes to the growing body of knowledge on FL-\nHCC and emphasizes the need for further research to improve the \ndiagnosis and treatment of this disease.\nConclusion\nFibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare variant of \nhepatocellular carcinoma that typically affects young individuals \nwithout underlying liver disease. This case report presented a young \nadult with FL-HCC, highlighting the diagnostic and therapeutic \nchallenges encountered. The patient's clinical course, diagnostic \nworkup, treatment approach, and outcome were detailed, and a \ncomprehensive literature review was provided to summarize the \ncurrent understanding of FL-HCC. Early recognition and appropriate \nmanagement of FL-HCC are crucial for improving patient outcomes. \nFurther research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of FL-HCC \nand develop more effective treatment strategies.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the patient for her consent to \npublish this case report.\nReferences\n1.

As shown in Table 1, the incidence of gastric cancer varies significantly by \ngeographical region. East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America have higher rates compared to \nother parts of the world [2]. Historically, gastric cancer has been more commonly associated with \nolder age groups, typically those over 50 years old. However, in recent years, there has been a notable \nincrease in the number of gastric cancer cases diagnosed in young adults (aged 18-39 years) [3].\nThe reasons for this emerging trend are multifactorial and not fully understood. Lifestyle \nfactors, such as poor diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and high stress levels, may play a role. \nAdditionally, genetic predisposition and certain infectious agents, like Helicobacter pylori (H. \npylori) infection, have been implicated in the development of gastric cancer in both young and \nolder populations [4].\nThe diagnosis of gastric cancer in young adults can be challenging due to the non-specific nature \nof early symptoms, which are often mistaken for common gastrointestinal disorders. As a result, \nmany young patients are diagnosed at more advanced stages, leading to poorer prognosis. This case \nreport details the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of a young adult with gastric \ncancer, along with a review of the current literature on this topic.\nCase Presentation\nPatient history\nA 29-year-old male office worker presented to the outpatient clinic with a three-month history \nof intermittent upper abdominal pain. The pain was described as a dull ache, non-radiating, and was \nnot associated with meals. He also reported a recent loss of appetite, resulting in a 5-kg weight loss \nover the past two months. The patient had a long history of poor dietary habits, including a high \nintake of processed foods, frequent consumption of fast food, and irregular meal times. He was a \nnon-smoker but admitted to occasional alcohol consumption on weekends. There was no family \nhistory of cancer or significant medical conditions.\nPhysical examination\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared thin and pale. His vital signs were within normal \nlimits, with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate \nof 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 36.8\u00b0C. The abdominal examination revealed mild \ntenderness in the epigastric region, but no palpable masses, organomegaly, or signs of ascites. The"

The white blood cell \ncount and platelet count were normal. Liver function tests, renal \nfunction tests, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. The \nserum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was elevated at 10 ng/\nmL (normal range: < 5 ng/mL), while the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 \n(CA19-9) level was normal.\nImaging studies\nA contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the \nabdomen and pelvis was performed, which revealed a thickened \ngastric wall in the antrum, measuring approximately 1.5 cm in \nthickness. There was also evidence of regional lymphadenopathy, \nwith several enlarged lymph nodes in the perigastric and celiac axis \nregions. The CT scan did not show any signs of distant metastases.\nEndoscopic examination and biopsy\nSubsequently, the patient underwent \nesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The endoscopic examination \nrevealed an irregular, ulcerated mass in the gastric antrum, measuring \napproximately 3 cm in diameter. Multiple biopsies were taken \nfrom the mass, and histological examination showed moderately \ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining \nconfirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, with positive expression \nof cytokeratin 7 and negative expression of cytokeratin 20.\nStaging and treatment\nThe patient was staged as T2N1M0 according to the TNM staging \nsystem for gastric cancer. He was referred to the surgical oncology \ndepartment, and a subtotal gastrectomy with regional lymph node \ndissection was performed. The surgical specimen confirmed the \npresence of adenocarcinoma in the gastric antrum, with invasion into \nthe muscularis propria and involvement of 3 out of 15 regional lymph \nnodes.\nPostoperatively, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with \na combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) \nfor six cycles. During the chemotherapy, the patient experienced \nsome side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, which \nwere managed with appropriate supportive medications.\nFollow-up\nThe patient was followed up regularly with physical examinations, \nlaboratory tests, and imaging studies. At the one-year follow-up, there \nwas no evidence of recurrence. The patient's anemia had resolved, \nand his overall condition had improved. He was advised to maintain \na healthy diet and lifestyle and continue with regular follow-up.\nLiterature Review\nEpidemiology\nIn recent years, the incidence of gastric cancer in young adults \nhas been on the rise. A meta-analysis published in 2022 [3] showed \nthat the age-standardized incidence rate of gastric cancer in young \nadults increased by 1.2% per year from 1990 to 2019 in the United \nStates. Similar trends have been reported in other parts of the world, \nincluding Asia and Europe. Although the overall incidence of gastric \ncancer in young adults is still relatively low compared to older \nage groups, this emerging trend highlights the need for increased \nawareness and early detection efforts.\nRisk factors\nLifestyle factors: Poor dietary habits, such as a high intake of \nprocessed foods, red meat, and salt, and a low intake of fruits and \nvegetables, have been associated with an increased risk of gastric \ncancer in young adults [5]. The case presented here also had a history \nof poor diet, with a preference for fast food and processed foods. \nAdditionally, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are well-\nestablished risk factors for gastric cancer, and their prevalence among \nyoung adults may contribute to the rising incidence of the disease [6].\nH. pylori infection: H. pylori infection is one of the \nmost important risk factors for gastric cancer, accounting for \napproximately 70-90% of cases [4]. Although the prevalence of H. \npylori infection has been decreasing in some developed countries, it \nremains a significant problem in many parts of the world, especially \nin developing countries. In young adults, H. pylori infection may be \nacquired through contaminated food and water, or person-to-person \ntransmission [7].\nGenetic factors: Genetic predisposition plays a role in the \ndevelopment of gastric cancer, with approximately 10% of cases having \na family history of the disease [8]. In young adults, certain genetic \nsyndromes, such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous \npolyposis, are associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. \nHowever, in most cases, the genetic mutations are sporadic and not \nassociated with known syndromes.\nClinical features: The clinical presentation of gastric cancer \nin young adults is often non-specific, similar to that of common \ngastrointestinal disorders. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, \nvomiting, loss of appetite, and weight loss are common, but they are \noften overlooked or misdiagnosed. In addition, young adults may be \nmore likely to present with advanced-stage disease, as they may delay \nseeking medical attention due to the belief that their symptoms are \nnot serious [9].\nDiagnosis: The diagnosis of gastric cancer in young adults is \nsimilar to that in older patients, with EGD and biopsy being the gold \nstandard. However, due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, \nRegion Incidence Rate\nEast Asia 25-50\nEastern Europe 15-30\nSouth America 10-20\nNorth America 5-10\nWestern Europe 5-10\nTable 1: Global Incidence Rates of Gastric Cancer by Region (per 100,000 \npopulation).\nParameter Result Normal Range\nHemoglobin (g/dL) 10 13-17\nMean Corpuscular Volume (fL) 75 80-100\nMean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (pg) 25 27-34\nWhite Blood Cell Count (\u00d7109/L) 7.5 4-11\nPlatelet Count (\u00d7109/L) 200 150-450\nCEA (ng/mL) 10 < 5\nCA19-9 (U/mL) 20 0-37\nTable 2: Laboratory Test Results of the Patient."

In addition, the use of non-invasive \nscreening tests, such as serum biomarkers and upper gastrointestinal \nimaging, may be limited in young adults, as the prevalence of gastric \ncancer is low in this population [10].\nTreatment: The treatment of gastric cancer in young adults is \nbased on the same principles as in older patients, with surgery being \nthe mainstay of curative treatment. However, young adults may be \nmore likely to tolerate aggressive treatment, including chemotherapy \nand radiation therapy, and may have a better performance status. \nThe choice of treatment depends on the stage of the disease, the \npatient's overall health, and their preferences. In recent years, there \nhas been an increasing interest in the use of targeted therapies and \nimmunotherapies for the treatment of gastric cancer, and these may \noffer new treatment options for young adults with advanced disease \n[11].\nPrognosis: The prognosis of gastric cancer in young adults is \ngenerally poorer than that in older patients, even when diagnosed \nat the same stage. This may be due to several factors, including the \nmore aggressive biological behavior of the tumor in young adults, \nthe higher likelihood of advanced-stage disease at diagnosis, and the \nlack of awareness among healthcare providers and patients about the \npossibility of gastric cancer in young individuals [12]. However, with \nearly detection and appropriate treatment, the prognosis of gastric \ncancer in young adults can be improved.\nDiscussion\nThis case report highlights the importance of considering gastric \ncancer in the differential diagnosis of young adults with persistent \nabdominal symptoms, even in the absence of a family history of \ncancer. The patient in this case had a history of poor dietary habits, \nwhich may have contributed to the development of gastric cancer. \nThe non-specific nature of his symptoms initially led to a delay in \ndiagnosis, emphasizing the need for a high index of suspicion among \nhealthcare providers.\nThe literature review reveals that the incidence of gastric cancer \nin young adults is increasing, and there are several risk factors that \nare particularly relevant to this population. Lifestyle modifications, \nsuch as a healthy diet, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol \nconsumption, may help reduce the risk of gastric cancer in young \nadults. In addition, screening for H. pylori infection and appropriate \ntreatment may also play a role in preventing the development of \ngastric cancer.\nEarly detection is crucial for improving the prognosis of gastric \ncancer in young adults. Healthcare providers should be aware of \nthe non-specific symptoms that may be associated with gastric \ncancer in this population and should not hesitate to perform further \ninvestigations, including EGD, when indicated. The treatment of \ngastric cancer in young adults should be individualized, taking into \naccount the patient's overall health, preferences, and the stage of the \ndisease.\nConclusion\nGastric cancer in young adults is an emerging public health \nconcern. This case report and literature review emphasize the need \nfor increased awareness of the risk factors, clinical features, and \nappropriate management of gastric cancer in young individuals. \nBy promoting a healthy lifestyle, early detection, and appropriate \ntreatment, the prognosis of gastric cancer in young adults can be \nimproved. Further research is needed to better understand the \nunderlying mechanisms of the rising incidence of gastric cancer in \nyoung adults and to develop more effective prevention and treatment \nstrategies.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the patient for his consent to \npublish this case report.\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n1.

They account for a significant proportion of extracranial head and neck \ntumors, occurring in approximately 25% to 48% of all cases in this region with acoustic nerve \ninvolvement in most cases [1]. These tumors are typically slow-growing, encapsulated, and \nasymptomatic, making early diagnosis difficult.  \nWhile schwannomas are considered the most common benign neoplasms of the pharynx, their \noccurrence in the palatine tonsil is exceptionally rare. Fewer than ten cases have been reported in \nthe literature [2,3]. The clinical presentation of tonsillar schwannomas is often nonspecific, ranging \nfrom a foreign body sensation to dysphagia, sore throat, or obstructive symptoms. This usually leads \nto misdiagnosis as chronic tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, or lymphoma [4].\nWe present a rare case of a tonsillar schwannoma in a 20-year-old female patient, including \nclinical presentation, diagnostic approach, surgical management, and histopathological findings.\nSchwannomas arising in the tonsil are extremely uncommon. We report a case of tonsillar \nschwannoma in a 23-year-old woman. We also review the literature on this rare entity. \nCase Presentation\nA 20-year-old female patient presented to Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck \nSurgery complaining of dyspnea in the supine position and dysphagia lasting for several weeks. \nPatient had history of mefedron abuse. \nA pedunculated tumor arising from the left palatine tonsil was revealed on physical examination. \nThe mass was moving during act of respiration (Figure 1). Additionally, an anterior nasal septal \nperforation was noted.\nA prior contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed a soft tissue mass originating from the left  \npalatine tonsil, showing contrast enhancement, measuring 26 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 14 mm (Figures 2 and 3), \nwithout tumor extensions.\nThe tonsillectomy was performed and sent for histopathological evaluation. The pathology \nreport confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma with immunohistochemical staining positive for \nS100 and negative for Caldesmon, Desmin, SMA, and CD34.\nAt follow-up, there were no signs of tumor recurrence."

Common symptoms \ninclude dysphagia, foreign body sensation, odynophagia, or, less \nfrequently, respiratory difficulty. In our case, the patient presented \nwith dyspnea in the supine position and progressive dysphagia, which \nare consistent with the lesion's obstructive nature.\nDue to their rarity and nonspecific symptoms, tonsillar \nschwannomas are frequently misdiagnosed as chronic tonsillar \nhypertrophy, salivary gland neoplasms, or malignancies such as \nlymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma [4]. Imaging studies can aid \nin preoperative assessment. While computed tomography (CT) can \nreveal a well-defined enhancing mass, magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) prov ides superior soft tissue contrast. It is considered the \nimaging modality of choice for neural tumors [1]. Nevertheless, \nimaging alone is not diagnostic; definitive diagnosis relies on \nhistopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation.\nHistologically, schwannomas display a biphasic pattern consisting \nof Antoni A and Antoni B areas. Antoni A regions are hypercellular, \ncomposed of spindle-shaped Schwann cells arranged in fascicles with \nnuclear palisading (Verocay bodies). Antoni B areas are hypocellular, \nwith loosely arranged cells in a myxoid stroma and microcystic \nchanges [4]. Immunohistochemically, schwannomas typically stain \npositively for S100 protein, which confirms their neural crest origin. \nIn our case, the tumor showed strong S100 positivity and was negative \nfor markers such as Desmin, SMA, Caldesmon, and CD34, consistent \nwith a diagnosis of schwannoma.\nTreatment consists of complete surgical excision. These tumors \nare usually well-encapsulated, allowing for enucleation without \nrequiring wide excision or sacrifice of surrounding structures [2,3]. \nNeck dissection is not indicated due to the low risk of lymphatic \nspread. Recurrence after complete excision is rare, and the overall \nprognosis is excellent [2].\n Our patient also presented with a nasal septal perforation, likely \nrelated to intranasal mephedrone use. While drug-induced septal \nperforation is a well-documented complication of stimulant abuse, \nthere is no current evidence linking such substances to schwannoma \ndevelopment. This finding, however, underscores the importance of a \nthorough clinical history and examination in patients presenting with \nunusual head and neck pathology.\nConclusion\nAlthough tonsillar schwannomas are rare tumors, they should \nbe considered in the differential diagnosis of palatine tonsil \ntumors, particularly when imaging shows a well-circumscribed, \nenhancing lesion. Despite their rarity, clinical suspicion followed \nby histopathological confirmation allows for curative treatment \nthrough complete surgical excision. Histopathological analysis \nremains essential for diagnosis. The prognosis is excellent; recurrence \nis uncommon when complete resection is achieved. This case \ncontributes to the limited literature and raises awareness of this rare \nentity among clinicians and pathologists.\nConsent\nInformed written consent was obtained from the patient for \npublication of this case report and accompanying images.\nEthical Approval\nThis study was conducted in accordance with institutional ethical \nstandards.\nReferences\n1.

Today, one third \nof the global population suffers from TB. Extrapulmonary TB, found in the musculoskeletal system, \nis an uncommon infection caused by tuberculous bacilli, and constitutes 1-5% of all forms of TB. \nApproximately 30% of skeletal TB cases involve joints, with the knee being the third most affected \njoint, after the spine and the hip joints. TB of the knee commonly presents as synovitis or arthritis, \nand the presence of a cyst is a rather rare complication. Here, we report a case of TB arthritis in a \nnative knee, initially presenting as a Baker\u2019s cyst, without systemic signs or symptoms.\nCase Presentation\nThe patient is a 48-year-old female with no specific history, other than vitiligo treated with \nsteroid medication for several months. Th e patient had an aspiration of cystic mass and received \nNSAID medication from a local clinic about 6 months, but aggravated pain of the left knee. So, she \nvisited to our clinic. Upon physical examination, we could palpate a 7 cm \u00d7 15 cm soft mass on the \nmedial side of the proximal tibia, for which the patient complained of tenderness. The patient\u2019s \npain was aggravated during extension of the knee; however, there were no neurological symptoms, \nredness, or local heat, which would suggest an infection. On x-ray imaging of the knee, there were \nno significant findings, such as arthritic changes (Figure 1A and B). A chest X-ray was also \ninterpreted as normal. In the hematologic examination, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) \nwas slightly elevated, and all other factors were within the normal ranges.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI; INGENIA 3.0T, Philips, Netherlands) was performed to \nconfirm the characteristics of the mass. The musculoskeletal radiologist interpreted the images \nas showing diffuse and thick enhancing synovial proliferation involving the joint capsule, and an \nelongated, complex cystic mass with diffuse high T2 signal intensity between the semimembranosus \nand medial gastrocnemius muscles like as Baker\u2019s cyst. There were no signs of arthritis due to \nligament or cartilage damage in the joint (Figure 2A and B).\nUnder the spinal anesthesia, we excised the mass in the supine position and a tourniquet applied \nat the proximal thigh. Intraoperative fi ndings showed a cyst with unclear proximal and/or distal \nmargins \nand adhesion to adjacent soft tissues due to inflammation, which presented differently \nthan a Baker\u2019s cyst. There was friable soft tissue, and the mass was excised. Histological findings \nshowed caseous necrosis and tuberculosis with granulomatous inflammation (Figure 3A-C).\nPostoperatively, a final biopsy results confirmed TB via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) TB \ntest. Other examinations, including a chest x-ray, chest computed tomography (CT), and sputum"

Based on the biopsy results, \nwe consulted with an internal medicine of tuberculosis specialist \nand started the patient on a daily anti-TB regimen, HRZE, which \nincluded isoniazid 100 mg (H), rifampin 600 mg (R), pyrazinamide \n500 mg (Z), and ethambutol 400 mg (E). During follow-up, she \ncomplained a limited range of motion (ROM) and continuous knee \npain in her everyday life. Follow-up x-rays showed rapid \ndegenerative changes to the knee along with destruction of the joint. \nAfter 9 months of treatment with HRZE, the patient\u2019s day-to-day life \nhad become difficult due to the pain caused by the severe destruction \nof \nthe knee joint (Figure 4A and B). A total knee arthroplasty (TKA) \nand biopsy were performed (Figure 5). Additional TB treatment \nregimen(HR) was continued for a year to prevent a recurrence of \ninfection due to TB reactivation a\nfter TKA [4]. The patient recovered \nwithout \nany infection at the operation site, and experienced a \npostoperative alleviation of her pain with no sign of recurrence of the \ncystic mass (Figure \n6). The patient maintained without a recurrence \nof a tuberculous infection 5 years after the TKA.\nDiscussion\nThe knee is the third most common site of extrapulmonary \nTB, accounting for about 10% of skeletal TB lesions [8]. The most \ncommon symptom of skeletal TB is diffuse swelling with a subsequent \nprogressive loss of movement. Occasionally it can manifest as multiple \ndischarging sinuses and a triple deformity of the knee [8]. Although \nrare, the occurrence of a Baker's cyst along with TB of the knee has \nbeen previously described [1,5].\nA Baker's cyst is defined as a collection of fluid in the \ngastrocnemius\u2013semimembranosus bursa of the knee, and usually \nresults from an anatomical defect at the bursa\u2013joint interface, \ncompounded by pathologies which cause effusion of the knee \n[3,7]. The causes of knee effusions are commonly noninfectious, \nand secondary to meniscal tears, chondral lesions, osteoarthritis, \nFigure 1: (A) Preoperative findings showed a 7 x 15cm , soft mass on the \nmedial side of the left calf.

Although uncommon, infective etiologies can also \nresult in a Baker's cyst. Labropoulos et al. [7] confirmed in a casual \nanalysis study the rare occurrence of a tubercular etiology in a \nBaker\u2019s cyst. The presence of a tubercular popliteal cyst has been \npreviously reported in a patient with tubercular arthritis, and can \npresent as a ruptured popliteal cyst secondary to tubercular arthritis.\nA \nBaker's cyst by itself has no specific radiographic features, but \nfeatures of causative pathology can, at times, be seen on radiographs. \nIn our case, we did not find anything significant on the radiographs \nof the knee. Osteoarticular TB has classical radiographic features, \nsuch as the Phemister triad, which consists of juxta-articular \nosteoporosis, peripheral osseous erosions, and narrowing of the \njoint space; however, in the early stages, radiographic features are \nusually nonspecific [8]. The slow growth pattern of Mycobacterium \ntuberculosis and a deficiency of proteolytic enzymes explain the \npreservation of the joint space in the early stage of osteoarticular TB \n[9]. These early changes are better detected on MRI, which shows \narticular affection and synovial thickening, as seen in the case of our \npatient [6].\nOur patient complained of pain and a di ffuse swelling over \nthe proximal aspect of her left calf. The MRI of the left leg revealed a \npopliteal cyst (probably an infectious etiology) with no other \nabnormalities; hence, we planned excision and biopsy. Our patient \nstarted an anti-TB regimen as soon as the histopathology report \nconfirmed a diagnosis of tubercular synovitis. Despite a complete \nexcision of the cyst and appropriate anti-TB medication, the patient \nsuffered residual functional impairment due to pain and joint \ndestruction, as demonstrated at 9 months follow-up. It is thought \nthat immune insufficiency due to the long-term use of steroids to \ntreat a vitiligo a\nffects the activation of TB and joint destruction [2]. \nFollowing this thought process, we decided to perform a TKA to treat \nher rapidly progressed extrapulmonary TB-induced arthritis with \nanti-TB drugs.\nConclusion\nThis case highlights that an infected Baker\u2019s cyst can be a rare \ncause of unilateral lower-extremity pain and swelling. An infected or \nruptured cyst can be confused clinically with deep vein thrombosis \nor cellulitis, and these conditions can even coexist [10]. Generally, \nit \nis difficult to consider a primary diagnosis of a TB cyst in a soft  \ntissue periarticular joint mass. We therefore report that in the case \nof our patient, the TKA was necessary due to a failure to accelerate \nthe advancement of knee joint destruction after the cyst excision and \ntreatment with anti-TB drugs.\nAcknowledgement\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding \nagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

The British \nNational Formulary recommends initiating treatment with alternate-day intramuscular (i.m.) \nadministration of 1000 mcg hydroxocobalamin, maintaining this regimen until all symptoms have \nresolved or no longer improve.

Symptoms typically develop \ngradually over several months or even years and overlap with many other common disorders [1]. \nAlthough the classic presentation of deficiency is megaloblastic anemia caused by autoimmune \npernicious anemia [2,3], the majority of B12-deficient individuals in Western countries present \nwith neurological or cognitive symptoms rather than anemia or enlarged red blood cells [4]. These \ncomplaints include neurocognitive symptoms such as 'brain fog', memory problems, cognitive \nimpairment, insomnia, headaches (especially migraines), and learning difficulties. The most \nprominent neurologic symptoms are peripheral tingling sensations ('pins and needles'), numbness, \nnerve pain, muscle weakness, poor balance, dizziness, and ringing in the ears. General symptoms \ninclude fatigue, weight loss, diarrhea, symptoms related to other nutrient deficiencies, and \nsometimes darkening of the skin [4].\nChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare, immune-mediated \ndisorder in which an abnormal immune response causes damage to the protective covering of \nnerves and to the nerve fibers themselves. The exact cause of CIDP remains unknown [5]. Patients \nexperience progressive weakness, impaired sensory function in the legs and arms, loss of deep \ntendon reflexes, and general symptoms like fatigue. CIDP is a long-term condition with a variable \ncourse that can be relapsing-remitting, stepwise progressive, or gradually progressive [5].\nGuidelines from the European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society \n(EFNS/PNS) provide recommendations for CIDP treatments, aiming to reduce symptoms and, \nif possible, maintain long-term remission [6]. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin \n(IVIG) or corticosteroids is recommended for patients with moderate to severe disability. If \nIVIG and corticosteroids are ineffective, plasma exchange should be considered. If the response \nis inadequate or the required drug maintenance dose is high, combination treatments with either \nimmunosuppressants or immunomodulators should be considered [5,6]. However, due to lack of \nevidence, there are no recommendations for long-term management.\nWe describe a 66-year-old man diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating \npolyneuropathy (CIDP), whose symptoms worsened in parallel with vitamin B12 deficiency.\nCase Presentation\nA male patient in his 60s was initially diagnosed in his 40s with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, which"

His breathing was not affected. \nHe was treated with two series of 5-day IVIG courses that restored \nmost functionality, but at such a low level that he required clinical \nrehabilitation for 8 months, followed by outpatient rehabilitation for \nalmost two years. During that period, he experienced several relapses \nthat were also treated with 5-day IVIG courses.\nAfter a significant relapse, he was referred to a university hospital \nfor a second opinion. His diagnosis was changed to CIDP, later revised \nto CIDP with acute onset. The Professor who performed the second \nopinion stated that he found a mild polyneuropahty togehter with \nclear axonal damage (EMG) but no signs of demyelinisation. In the \nfollowing years, CIDP was treated with IVIG, initially at three-week \nintervals. Over time, the decline after infusion accelerated, resulting \nin shorter intervals between infusions. Eventually, even two infusions \nper week were inadequate to counter the decline, and this treatment \nwas discontinued.\nThe patient was then given azathioprine, but this had no effect. \nHe was again referred to the university hospital for another opinion. \nHe was initially treated with five days of plasma exchange, but \nwithout effect. Subsequently, he started prednisolone treatment. \nAfter an initial improvement lasting two to three weeks, there was \nno further improvement in clinical symptoms, so the treatment was \ndiscontinued after several months.\nThe patient then went through a moderate period during \nwhich he felt very weak yet was diagnosed as being in remission. A \nnew episode of inpatient rehabilitation for 8 months, followed by \noutpatient therapy for over a year, resulted in a slight functional \nimprovement. However, he again experienced substantial worsening \nof his symptoms, especially muscle weakness.\nHis CIDP was presumed to be relapsing, and IVIG was restarted. \nHe began using a pedometer to objectively measure his exercise \ncapacity, and IVIG treatment clearly improved this (Figure 1, blue \nline), but not to the level he had achieved in previous years.\nSubsequently, laboratory tests revealed a vitamin B12 deficiency \nin addition to his CIDP. The total serum B12 concentration was \n85 pmol/L (160-700 pmol/l), and methylmalonic acid was 390 \nnmol/L (<350 nmol/l), reflecting a functional B12 deficiency. He \nhad no anemia (Hb 14.5 g/dl, MCV 91 fl). The upper digestive tract \nexamination was not performed.\nBecause he regularly consumed animal products, it was concluded \nthat he had B12 malabsorption because his antibodies against \nparietal cells were positive. He promptly started intramuscular (i.m.) \nhydroxocobalamin injections of 1000 mcg, three times per week, in \naddition to the weekly IVIG. This significantly improved his condition \n(Figure 1, orange line). He used a pedometer to measure the time it \ntook him to cover a certain distance to objectively assess his exercise \ncapacity. The combination of weekly IVIG and B12 injections three \ntimes per week enabled him to cover 2.6 km in 33 minutes on average.\nBecause he experienced that the effect of the B12 injections on his \nclinical condition was rather short-lasting, he switched to daily B12 \ninjections. This stabilized his condition throughout the week (Figure \n1, grey line, startup phase) and, over the course of a couple of weeks, \neven lessened the standard decline following IVIG (Figure 1, yellow \nline, steady phase).\nTo determine whether it was necessary to continue this high \nfrequency of B12 injections, which is not supported by current \nmedical guidelines, he deliberately reduced the injection frequency to \nthree times weekly and even skipped injections for a whole week. This \nimmediately resulted in a considerable drop in his exercise capacity, \nwith a lap time of 41 minutes in the week without a B12 injection. \nFurthermore, this also caused an increase in coordination disorders, \nmuscle tremors, and sensory impairment in the feet. After restarting \ndaily B12 injections, his exercise capacity gradually recovered.\nInvestigations \nWhen his symptoms worsened despite IVIG treatment, routine \nblood tests showed no specific abnormalities. Liver enzymes were \nnormal, as were kidney function and C-reactive protein. Serum \nB12 concentration was 85 pmol/L, and methylmalonic acid was 390 \nnmol/L. Homocysteine was not measured. Thyroid function was \nnormal. Tests for antibodies against stomach lining cells, intrinsic \nfactor, and thyroid peroxidase were not performed.\nOutcome and Follow-Up\nTreatment with high-frequency i.m. hydroxocobalamin \ninjections together with IVIG administration resulted in a \nconsiderable reduction of symptoms and improvement in exercise \ncapacity. During a trial of reducing and temporarily stopping high-\nfrequency B12 injections, the patient clearly experienced worsening \nof symptoms and exercise capacity, which was completely reversed \nafter restarting daily B12 administration.\nDiscussion\nOnce B12 deficiency due to B12 malabsorption has been \ndiagnosed, treatment consists of i.m. hydroxocobalamin injections, \nwhich should be maintained for life [4]. Most guidelines suggest that \nthe initial loading is with 1000 mcg hydroxocobalamin injections \ntwice a week or on alternate days until all symptoms have resolved or \ndo not improve further. Subsequently, the frequency of the injections \nis gradually reduced, and in most patients, the clinical improvement \nand absence of complaints can be maintained with one injection of \n1000 mcg every four weeks to two months.\nIn The Netherlands, drug therapy guidelines recommend \nadministering hydroxocobalamin 1000 mcg once or twice a week for \nup to two years in cases of neurological symptoms or abnormalities. \nHowever, it is unclear which neurological symptoms or abnormalities \nrequire such intensive treatment and how long-term treatment should \nbe continued after the initial two years. It may take several months or \neven years for neurological symptoms to resolve completely. Clinical \nevidence suggests that with longer duration and more severe B12 \ndeficiency, neurological symptoms are more likely to persist to some \ndegree [4]. People often continue to experience mild neurological \nsymptoms such as poor memory, impaired concentration, and fatigue \neven after 'adequate' B12 replacement [1,8,9].\nMany people with B12 deficiency report that the prescribed \nfrequency of B12 injections in the maintenance phase is insufficient to \nmanage symptoms [10,11]. They experience recurrence or worsening \nof symptoms when the interval between injections is extended or \nextended too quickly, and report that continuation of frequent i.m. \ninjections of hydroxocobalamin, ranging from twice-weekly to once \nevery 3-4 weeks [12], is needed to remain symptom-free.\nIt is not clear why certain patients require more frequent \ntreatment. It is also unknown why hydroxocobalamin administered \ndaily, or every other day may contribute to improving symptoms."

There is no \nliterature to support the fact that in some patients the benefit of an \nB12 injection can be so shortlived that is why we submit this case \nreport. Manny doctors have the misconception that B12 deficiency is \nruled out in patients without anemia which in turn has led to delayed \ndiagnosis notably in people presenting solely with neurological \nsymptoms. There is, however, literature supporting the fact that \nsome patients may experience recurrence or worsening of symptoms \nwhen the interval between injections is extended or extended too \nquickly, and they report that continuation of frequent intramuscular \nhydroxocobalamin injections, vaying between twice-weekly and \nonce every three to four weeks, is needed to remain asymptomatic. \nWhy certain patients require more frequent treatment is not yet \nunderstood.\nCobalamin is taken up into central and peripheral nervous tissue \nthrough the CD320 receptor [13], but recent studies have suggested \nthat an alternative, as yet unidentified mechanism for neural B12 \nuptake also exists [14]. CD320 is a complex receptor; it features an \nN-terminal, extracellular fragment comprising two Low-density \nLipoprotein Receptor Type A (LDLR-A) domains, separated by an \nepidermal growth factor (EGF) homology domain. The exact function \nof this domain has not yet been established, but it has been suggested \nthat it plays a crucial role in the binding of transcobalamin to the \nreceptor [15]. CD320 also contains a single transmembrane helix and \na C-terminal cell interior region involved in complex internalization.\nis no data on the effects of specific genetic variations in the genes \nencoding the different protein domains on CD320-transcobalamin \nbinding and uptake of cobalamin into the cell. The CD320 knockout \nmouse develops cobalamin deficiency in the nervous system, leading \nto loss of nerve myelin and inflammation [16]. A recent study showed \nthe presence of anti-transcobalamin receptor antibodies in a disease \ncalled cutaneous arteritis [17]. Theoretically, such antibodies could \ninterfere with transcobalamin binding to the receptor and subsequent \nuptake, altering the need for B12 supplementation. We urgently \nneed human studies exploring the effects of structural and post-\ntranslational changes on the CD320 receptor on the need for high-\nfrequency B12 administration and more information on the role of \nalternative neural B12 uptake in humans.\nThe effects of B12 on cell metabolism are multifold. It is an \nessential cofactor of methylmalonyl-Coenzyme A mutase in \nmitochondria, which converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, \nand plays a role in the breakdown of amino acids and odd-chain \nfatty acids. It also is a cofactor for methionine synthase (MS), which \ncatalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate \n(MTHF) to homocysteine to form methionine, and contributes to \nDNA methylation and glutathione synthesis. It also affects histone \nmodification and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In these \npathways, there is a complex interaction of B12 with other B-vitamins, \nincluding vitamins B1, B3, and folate (18). Disturbances in these \ncomplex networks may play a role in the mitochondrial dysfunction \nevidenced by persistent symptoms and different B12 supplementation \nneeds between individuals.\nThere are some indications in the literature that we may consider \ncobalamin a general nerve-protecting and -regenerating compound. \nCobalamin may regulate the balance between neurotoxic and nerve \ngrowth-promoting agents [19,20]. Micronutrients, including vitamin \nB12, might improve nerve function scores in people with type \n2 diabetes [21], but in this study, a mixture of nutrients was used, \nincluding multivitamins and oral vitamin B12. Another study reported \nthat vitamin B12 injections were more effective than nortriptyline in \nthe treatment of painful diabetic nerve damage [22]. A 2005 review \nof multiple studies [23] reported that high-dose oral cyanocobalamin \nor methylcobalamin had beneficial effects on symptoms of diabetic \nnerve damage, such as pain and abnormal sensations. In three studies, \ntreatment with methylcobalamin also improved automatic nervous \nsystem symptoms. Effects on vibration perception and electrical \nnerve function measures were inconsistent. However, one review \nfound no evidence that the use of oral vitamin B12 supplements is \nassociated with improvement in the clinical symptoms of diabetic \nnerve damage [24]. Low central nervous system cobalamin levels \nmay even play a role in the development of multiple sclerosis [25,26]. \nSimilar observations, and even reports of the beneficial effects of B12 \ninjection therapy, have been reported in people with chronic fatigue \nsyndrome, with and without widespread pain [27,28].\nThere is evidence that placebo treatments can have significant \nand sustained effects on clinical outcomes in multiple conditions, \nparticularly those where emotion and motivation play a central role \n[29]. While a placebo may, on average, improve exercise capacity, a \nrecent study of 28 trained cyclists showed that exercise performance \nremained unchanged in the majority of them, while it improved in \n11 and worsened in four [30]. In contrast, most intervention studies \nin heart failure patients found limited to no improvement in exercise \ncapacity in the placebo arm [31]. In vitamin B12 deficiency, there is \nno evidence that recovery from severe anemia or normalizing elevated \nmethylmalonic acid levels due to hydroxocobalamin injections \ncan be regarded as a placebo effect. Yet, when patients' neurologic \nor cognitive complaints improve through injection therapy, some \ndoctors consider this to be a placebo effect. This patient conducted a \nstudy with himself as the only subject. This type of study is increasingly \naccepted for evaluating the effects of treatment, especially in rare \ndiseases. The objective deterioration of his exercise capacity when \nreducing the frequency and skipping the B12 injections suggests a \nminimal role for a possible placebo effect.\nThere are no well-designed studies of hydroxocobalamin \ninjections in patients with neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin \nB12 deficiency to conform or reject the placebo effect. Clearly there is a \nneed for well-conducted double-blind, randomized studies in patients \nwith vitamin B12 deficiency who report the benefit of continued \nfrequent hydroxocobalamin injections vs oral supplementation. The \nbiomarkers for determining a functional vitamin B12 deficiency \nnormalize more rapidly than the improvement or reversal of \n(neurological) symptoms. Additionally, symptoms may reappear \nwithout changes in biomarker status. Therefore, these biomarkers \ncannot be used to determine that the vitamin B12 deficiency has been \ntreated optimally.\nIn summary, we discuss a patient with chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy who developed B12 deficiency during \nhis disease. Long-term daily hydroxocobalamin administration \nhas proved necessary to reduce symptoms and maximize exercise \ncapacity. The biological mechanism behind such high-frequency \ntreatment needs to be elucidated.\nLearning Points/Take Home Messages\n\u2022\t Vitamin B12 deficiency may  cause considerable"

Progress was slow and my \ncondition was very poor compared to my situation before the relapse. \nBlood tests showed a B12 deficiency but my physician was not very \nimpressed with the test results and told me the standard treatment of \n5 weeks B12 injections would be sufficient.\nIn conversations with fellow patients, they urged me to have a \nsecond opinion. During that specialist examination, it was determined \nthat I had a chronic B12 deficiency. Looking back, I think it may have \nbeen present for many years.\nAfter starting the B12 injections, my rehabilitation progress \nincreased and after a couple of months I was released from therapy. \nFrom experience during a previous rehabilitation, I knew how \nimportant exercise was. That is why I went for a walk every day. As \na researcher, I wanted to objectify my results using a pedometer. I \nnoticed that the day after a B12 shot I was stronger and faster than the \nother day, so after a while I took a B12 shot every day. This eased my \nloss of strength. I was stable all week and more importantly after a few \nweeks the decline after a IVIG became less severe, what a welcome \nresult!\nNow, seven years later, I still experience a huge advantage benefit \ntaking B12 every day. Friends and professional physicians suggested \nthat the effect may have been due to a placebo effect. Even when if it \nthat were true, I would gladly accept that outcome. Why throw away \na cheap mechanism that works without side effects? But in this case, \nI am sure there is no placebo effect. Why? Because every now and \nthen I felt less strength and energy, and when I checked (afterwards), \nit turned out that I had forgotten my B12 injection from the day \nbefore. So, I am fully convinced that B12 injections are essential to \nmy wellbeing. No one likes having needles in your skin, but I do like \nit because of the positive effects.\nReferences\n1.

The \nimmune system attacks and damage the oxyntic mucosa leading to chronic gastritis and destruction \nor loss of parietal cells [1]. This condition is associated with others autoimmune disorders, especially \ntype 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis [2]. Autoimmune atrophic gastritis is a preneoplastic \ncondition that predisposes to development of several malignancies, including type I neuroendocrine \ntumours and gastric adenocarcinoma. Whether AAG also predisposes to the development of gastric \nmucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is not clear. It is well known that gastric \nMALT lymphoma usually develops in the background of H. pylori positive chronic gastritis [3]. In \nthis study, we reported a case of H. pylori negative AAG who developed a gastric MALT lymphoma.\nCase Presentation \nA 51-year-old female suffering from autoimmune thyroiditis underwent serological screening \nfor other autoimmunity diseases, including autoimmune gastritis and hepatitis. She resulted \npositive for both anti-parietal cells and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, in addition to anti-nucleus \nand anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Therefore, in May 2018 she underwent high-definition white \nlight gastroscopy with chromoendoscopy by narrow band imaging (NBI). No visible neoplastic \nsuspicious lesions were detected; endoscopic findings were ipo-atrophic mucosal pattern in the \ncorpus and mucosal erythema in the antrum. Random biopsies of gastric mucosa were taken \naccording to the Updated Sydney System, i.e. two biopsies from the antrum, one from the incisura \nangularis and two from the corpus. Histological examination showed moderate atrophic gastritis \nwith pseudopyloric and intestinal metaplasia and linear hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells \nin the corpus and superficial non-atrophic gastritis with G cells iperplasia in the antrum (Figure \n1). Helicobacter pylori  were not found either in the antrum or in the corpus. Therefore, she was \ndiagnosed with H. pylori negative AAG. At the blood test, haemoglobin, cobalamin, vitamin D and \niron levels were normal, while serum gastrin and chromogranin were abnormally high. Serum IgG"

The patient accepted to participate to the \nmulticenter, observational study \u201cthe autoimmune gastritis in Italy- \nAG-ItaReg\u201d approved by the Ethical Committee of Area Vasta Emilia \nCentro, Bologna, Italy. The AG-ItaReg is a national prospective \nstudy aimed to create an online data-base registering all patients \ndiagnosed with autoimmune gastritis in the participants centers \nin Italy. The main outcome of this study is to assess predictors and \nincidence of gastric malignancies in patients with AAG. Thus, for \neach patient enrolled demographic, clinic, endoscopic and histologic \ncharacteristics along with the results of laboratory tests are collected \nand endoscopic follow-up is performed. \nAt the first follow-up endoscopy performed in November \n2020, an area of mucosal erythema in the greater curvature of the \ncorpus was found. During endoscopy, targeted biopsies from the \narea of mucosal erythema and random biopsies from the antrum \nand corpus were taken. The histological evaluation of targeted \nbiopsies revealed a severe infiltrate of lymphoid elements arranged \nin aggregates or dispersed in the lamina propria as for the presence \nof gastric MALT lymphoma, while random biopsies confirmed the \ncorpus-limited atrophic gastritis without H. pylori infection. At the \nimmunohistochemical stain the diagnosis of gastric MALT lymphoma \nderived from peripheral B lymphocytes of the marginal area was \nconfirmed (Figure 2). Lymphoid population was predominantly of \ntype B, Cyclin D (CD) 20 and IRTA positives and CD1, CD5, CD10, \nCD23 and MNDA negatives, with low growth fraction/MIB1 and \nkappa/lambda ratio not clearly unbalanced. \nIn December 2020, the patient was referred to the Haematological \nUnit of our hospital for the staging and treatment of gastric MALT \nlymphoma. She underwent \n13C-urea breath test (UBT) for H. pylori, \nendoscopic ultrasound sonography (EUS) of the stomach, neck-\nthoraco-abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan and osteo-\nmedullary biopsy. As expected, the UBT was negative confirming the \nabsence of H. pylori infection. The EUS showed a minimal thickening \nof the mucosal layer in the area involved by marginal lymphoma and \nno peri-gastric lymphadenopathy. No significant lymphadenopathy \nwas detected at the CT scan and the bone marrow biopsy resulted \nnegative. \nHaematologists decided to treat the patient with anti-CD20 \nmonoclonal antibody (rituximab), but the treatment was delayed \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemy for the high risk of infection related \nFigure 1: Histological features of autoimmune atrophic gastritis.

Electronic \nsearch identified 519 records after duplicates were removed, of which \n22 articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, only one reported \nthe development of gastric MALT lymphoma in one patient with \nAAG [5]. However, because of the concomitant presence of H. pylori \ninfection, the article was excluded. Therefore, no article met the \ninclusion criteria and was included in the review (Figure 3). \nIndeed, this is the first case-report describing the development \nof gastric MALT lymphoma in the background of H. pylori negative \nAAG. Chronic gastritis can arise from H. pylori infection or may start \nas an autoimmune condition. In both scenarios, persistent antigenic \nstimulation leading to chronic inflammation is associated with \nan increased risk of malignancies [6,7] . In addition, autoimmune \ndiseases can predispose to development of MALT lymphoma; there \nis evidence that Sjogren syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis \nare associated with an increased risk of salivary gland and thyroid \nMALT lymphoma, respectively [8]. In autoimmune diseases, the \nongoing inflammation and antigenic stimulation could stimulate \nthe growth and clonal expansion of B or T cells, elevating the risk \nof genetic anomalies and consequent lymphoma development [9] . \nFurthermore, there are reports of autoimmune conditions emerging \nduring lymphoma progression suggesting a mutual relationship \nbetween autoimmunity and lymphoid tumours [10]. There is evidence \nthat about 10% of patients with gastric MALT lymphoma are positive \nfor parietal cells antibodies, albeit in absence of atrophic gastritis \n[11]. However, the biological mechanisms linking autoimmune \ndiseases and lymphoma remain largely elusive and require further \ninvestigation.\nConclusion \nIn conclusion, our study suggests that AAG can predispose to the \ndevelopment of gastric MALT lymphoma, which is in line with other \nautoimmune diseases. Our findings further support the guideline \nrecommendation to perform endoscopic surveillance in patients with \nAAG for the secondary prevention of gastric malignancies. Indeed, \nlarge prospective cohort studies with a long-term follow-up are \nneeded to clarify the relationship between AAG and gastric MALT \nlymphoma.\nReferences\n1.

AVB can be classified as hereditary or secondary \nbased on its etiology. Despite advancements in gene sequencing, the pathogenic genes and mutation \nsites underlying inherited AVB require further exploration. \nResults: Our investigation identified a novel mutation (NM_ 170707: c.1609-1G>C) within \nthe LMNA gene in the proband (IL-2), which is absent in healthy family members. Protein \nelectrophoresis and cDNA sequencing indicated that this mutation alters the splicing pattern of the \nLMNA gene, potentially leading to exon 10 skipping.\nConclusion: We have discovered a novel mutation site (NM_170707.4: c.1609-1G>C) within the \nLMNA gene that is closely associated with AVB occurrence among members of a family lineage. The \nfindings underscore the importance of genetic factors in AVB pathogenesis.\nKeywords: Atrioventricular block, LMNA gene, Whole-exome sequencing, Lineage survey\nLiangliang Zhang1#, Jiao Tang1#, Guodu Liu1#, Maohuan Lin2, Xiaoqin Xiao3, Xin Chen1, Feng \nWang1, Chen Xie1*, Huanji Zhang1* \n1Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China\n2Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, \nChina\n3Center for Molecular Diagnostics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China\n#Authors contributed equally\nOPEN ACCESS\n *Correspondence:\nChen Xie, Department of \nCardiovascular Medicine, The Eighth \nAffiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen \nUniversity, Shenzhen, China, Tel: +86 \n83982222;\nE-mail: xiech26@mail.sysu.edu.cn\nHuanji Zhang, Department of \nCardiovascular Medicine, The Eighth \nAffiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen \nUniversity, Shenzhen, China,\nE-mail: zhanghj65@mail.sysu.edu.cn\nReceived Date: 06 May 2025\nAccepted Date: 20 May 2025\nPublished Date: 21 May 2025\nCitation: \nZhang L, Tang J, Liu G, Lin M, Xiao X, \nChen X, et al.

The increased susceptibility to AVB observed \namong first-degree relatives of affected individuals suggests a genetic predisposition to its \ndevelopment [1]. With the advancement of gene sequencing technologies, a growing number of \ngenes associated with cardiac conduction disorders have been identified, regardless of the presence \nof structural cardiac abnormalities. \nIn this study, we investigated a three-generation Chinese family with AVB. AVB was the \npredominant clinical manifestation, with no apparent skeletal muscle abnormalities or structural \nsigns of dilated cardiomyopathy observed. Through whole-exome sequencing and cDNA analysis, \nwe identified a novel LMNA gene mutation (NM_170707.4: c.1609-1G>C) that appears to be closely \nassociated with the development of AVB in this family.\nCase Presentation\nPopulation\nInformed consent was obtained from three generations of family members in a Chinese family \ngrappling with hereditary AVB. Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee \nof the Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the \nfamily pedigree. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on three family members with AVB, \nalong with two immediate family members without AVB. Comprehensive data, including clinical \ncharacteristics, diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, laboratory data, and extant medical records \nof deceased patients, were meticulously collated.\nGene sequencing and verification\nThe control group was drawn from the human B37 database of the Novo Genomics Institute \n(Beijing, China).

Subsequently, pathogenic mutation \nsites were scrutinized to discern the dominant pattern across family \nlines. Following screening, mutation sites situated within a splice \nregion underwent cDNA sequencing and protein electrophoresis to \nauthenticate functional impacts.\nClinical data\nAt the time of this study, four members of the family (I-1, II-2, II-\n3, and II-4) exhibited cardiac conduction disorders. Table 1 delineates \nthe clinical features of the affected family members, and Figure 2 \nshows the cardiac MRI of the proband (II-2). The proband (II-2) \npresented at the age of 39 with dizziness following physical activity. \nElectrocardiography (ECG) revealed marked bradycardia and third-\ndegree atrioventricular block (AVB), for which a pacemaker was \nimplanted. Her mother (I-1), who had no history of coronary artery \ndisease, diabetes, or hypertension, died of heart failure at the age of 59. \nAt age 39, her ECG had already shown third-degree AVB, which was \ninitially managed conservatively; however, progressive heart failure \ndeveloped following pacemaker implantation. One of the proband\u2019s \nsisters (II-3) experienced dizziness at the age of 35. Her initial \nECG revealed sinus bradycardia and second-degree type II AVB. \nFurther evaluation with echocardiography and cardiac magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an atrial septal aneurysm \nand uncoordinated myocardial contractility. Endomyocardial biopsy \n(EMB) showed no significant abnormalities, and she subsequently \nunderwent vagal ganglion ablation.Another sister (II-4) was \ndiagnosed at the age of 32 after presenting with dizziness. Her initial \nECG showed sinus arrhythmia and first-degree AVB. One year later, \nrepeat ECG revealed sinus arrest and second-degree AVB. Both ECG \nand cardiac MRI failed to reveal structural abnormalities, and she was \ntreated with the implantation of a Medtronic A3DR01 pacemaker.\nSummary of whole-exome sequencing\nWhole-exome sequencing was performed on the proband (II-2), \nher father (I-2), and her sisters (II-3, II-4, and II-5). The sequencing \nsamples exhibited an average data volume of 10.52G, with an average \neffective data volume of 99.05%.  The average Q20 reached 98.13%, \nwhile the average Q30 stood at 94.76%, with an average error rate \nof 0.03%.

Protein gel electrophoresis and cDNA sequencing \nhighlighted that the presence of the LMNA gene NM_170707.4: \nc.1609-1G>C disrupts the splicing pattern of the LMNA gene, \npotentially instigating exon 10 skipping in one allele. This aberrant \nsplicing pattern may be the predominant factor contributing to the \nmalfunctioning of the LMNA gene.\nDiscussion\nThis study identified a heterozygous mutation, c.1609-1G>C \n(exon 10, NM_170707), in the LMNA gene through whole-exome \nsequencing and multiple bioinformatic prediction tools. Located \nwithin a canonical splice site, this variant is likely to cause exon \n10 skipping, leading to a frameshift and altered protein structure. \nAccording to the ACMG classification criteria, the variant was \ndeemed pathogenic (PVS1, PM2, PP1, PP3), exhibiting dominant \ninheritance and cosegregation within the family. These findings \nstrongly implicate this mutation in the pathogenesis of hereditary \nAVB in this pedigree.\nThe LMNA gene, located on chromosome 1q21.1\u201321.2, consists \nof 12 exons and encodes type A lamins, key components of the \nnuclear lamina. Alternative splicing of LMNA gives rise to four major \nisoforms: lamin A, lamin C, lamin C2, and lamin A\u039410 [2,3]. Among \nthese, lamin A and lamin C are the principal products, generated \nvia alternative splicing of exon 10. Lamin A is initially synthesized \nas prelamin A, which undergoes multiple post-translational \nmodifications to form the mature protein [4]. Lamin C2, specifically \nexpressed in mouse germ cells, plays a specialized role in nuclear \nstructural dynamics and chromosome organization during mitosis \n[5,6]. Lamin A and C proteins, which are encoded by the LMNA gene, \nare essential structural proteins within the cell nucleus that are crucial \nfor nuclear morphology, DNA replication, and gene expression \n[3]. LMNA gene mutations can precipitate structural or functional \nabnormalities in lamin A and C proteins, thereby disrupting normal \nnuclear functions such as signal transduction and myocardial cell \nstructure [2].\n These mutations may disrupt ion channel function and \nion conduction, manifesting in AVB within the cardiac conduction \nsystem [7].\nClinically, mutations in LMNA are most commonly associated \nwith dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), heart failure, and rhythm \ndisturbances [8]. As a key gene in DCM pathogenesis, LMNA harbors \na broad spectrum of pathogenic variants. Affected individuals often \nexhibit progressive conduction defects, and some also present with \nskeletal muscle involvement [9,10]. Notably, LMNA mutations \naccount for approximately 33% of familial DCM cases with AVB \nand follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern [7]. While \nLMNA mutations are often suspected in patients with dilated \ncardiomyopathy (DCM) accompanied by atrioventricular block \n(AVB), their identification is equally important in young patients \npresenting with AVB alone or with only subtle structural cardiac \nchanges. In this case, the absence of overt myocardial involvement \ncan delay or obscure diagnosis, despite the underlying genetic \netiology. Early recognition of LMNA-related conduction disease\u2014\neven before the onset of significant cardiomyopathy\u2014can enable \ntimely intervention, family screening, and longitudinal monitoring \nfor progressive cardiac dysfunction.\nWithin the family evaluated in this study, all affected members \nexhibited singular AVB without observable structural changes in the \nheart. The pathogenic effects of the LMNA gene mutation appear \nto initiate in the conduction cells of the atrioventricular node or \nHis bundle; the subsequent effects in cardiac cells lead to atrial and \nventricular dilatation, ultimately resulting in heart failure [11]. A \nrecent UK-based cohort study involving 1,167 individuals with \nLMNA mutations reported a mean age of disease onset at 67 years \n[12]. In contrast, all affected members in our study developed AVB \nbefore the age of 40, highlighting a significantly earlier onset in this \nfamily.  Conduction system disorders typically precede the onset \nof DCM by several years to a decade or more in LMNA-related \nconditions [13]. Given the poor prognosis associated with LMNA \nmutation carriers\u2014especially those who develop early conduction \ndefects\u2014early genetic screening and identification are critical for \nimproving clinical outcomes through timely intervention, close \nmonitoring, and preventive management [14]. \nTo date, 498 distinct LMNA mutations and 300 protein \nvariants have been documented; these mutations and variants are \ncollectively associated with a diverse range of diseases that are \ncollectively termed \"laminopathy\" (http://www.umd.be/LMNA/). \nLMNA gene mutations are implicated in Emery\u2013Dreifuss muscular \ndystrophy [15], limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B [16], DCM \nwith conduction defect [10], autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-\nTooth disease [17], familial partial lipodystrophy type Dunnigan \n[18], myoadenylat deaminase [19], Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria \nsyndrome [20], restrictive dermopathy [21], and other conditions. \nIn the present study, we identified a heterozygous mutation, c.1609-\n1G>C (exon 10, NM_170707), in a multigenerational family affected \nby AVB. In computational prediction suggested that this splice-site \nvariant would lead to exon 10 skipping, which was subsequently \nvalidated through cDNA sequencing and electrophoresis. Given its \nlocation at a canonical splice acceptor site, this mutation may result \nin isoform switching\u2014the generation of alternative splicing variants \nwith altered function. We propose that the aberrant isoform in this \nfamily exhibits tissue-specific expression, preferentially impairing \ncardiac conduction tissue while sparing myocardium or other muscle \nsystems. This may underlie the cardiac-predominant phenotype \nobserved in our pedigree. In a similar investigation, a c.1609-3C>G \nvariant in LMNA was identified within a family with limb-girdle \nmuscular dystrophy; notably, at least three affected relatives exhibited \ncardiac involvement distinct from the primary muscular symptoms \n[22]. Although further studies are imperative to fully elucidate the \nclinical significance of LMNA splicing mutations, our results confirm \nthat these mutations manifest some degree of pathogenicity and can \nelicit diverse clinical phenotypes.\nThe advent of gene sequencing has unraveled an expanding \nspectrum of pathogenic genes associated with inherited AVB. Genetic \nmutations lie at the crux of inherited AVB, precipitating anomalies \nin the cardiac conduction system. Although pacemaker implantation \nremains the mainstay of treatment, it cannot prevent conduction \nblock recurrence or halt the progression of cardiac disease. Animal \nexperiments have demonstrated the benefits of gene therapies such as \ngene replacement therapy, gene editing therapy, and gene intervention \ntherapy in the treatment of inherited arrhythmias [23]. Gene editing \nplatforms like CRISPR-Cas9 facilitate precise modifications of \nmutated genes, making gene editing therapy for inherited AVB \nfeasible and practical. In our study, the LMNA mutation identified \nis a canonical splice-site variant, which differs mechanistically from \nmore commonly encountered missense mutations that result in \naltered protein products. This distinction may offer a therapeutic"

These RNA-targeted \napproaches are being actively explored in other splice-related diseases \nand could potentially be adapted for LMNA-related AVB. Therefore, \nunderstanding the specific nature of the mutation not only aids in \ndiagnosis and family screening but also informs individualized \ntherapeutic planning, laying the groundwork for future clinical \nintervention strategies tailored to this family\u2019s genetic profile.\nOne notable limitation of this study is that genetic sequencing \nwas only performed on second-generation (II) family members. \nDue to the death of the first-generation (I) proband, genotypic \nvalidation could not be conducted, leaving the precise origin of \nthe LMNA mutation unconfirmed within the pedigree. Moreover, \nthird-generation (III) members were not screened, precluding the \nassessment of whether the variant is present in asymptomatic or \npre-symptomatic individuals.

As a result, \nthe causal relationship between the LMNA variant and AVB in this \nfamily remains suggestive rather than conclusive, and further studies \ninvolving extended family members and larger cohorts are warranted. \nMoreover, this study relied exclusively on cDNA sequencing and \nelectrophoresis for verifying the variable splicing mutations of the \nLMNA gene; further cellular and animal experiments are needed \nto elucidate the complete clinical significance of LMNA splicing \nmutations.\nConclusion\nThis study revealed a novel mutation site (NM_170707.4: c.1609-\n1G>C) within the LMNA gene that is closely associated with AVB \noccurrence among a single-family lineage.

While traditional models have emphasized shared risk \nfactors such as aging, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction, newer evidence points \nto a more dynamic and causative framework: a reciprocal interactome composed of signaling \nmolecules, extracellular vehicles, and neurohormonal circuits linking cardiac and cerebral systems. \nCardiokines (e.g., natriuretic peptides, FGF21), neurokines (e.g., BDNF, NGF), exosomes carrying \nnoncoding RNAs, and systemic axes such as the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) \nand hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis act as molecular bridges that mediate cross-organ \ncommunication. This review shifts focus from risk association to causative molecular dialogue, \ndemonstrating how these interactomes drive remodeling, dysfunction, and progressive degeneration \nin both systems and repositions the heart\u2013brain axis as a site of active disease\u2013disease interaction, \nwhere reciprocal complications emerge from disrupted signaling rather than isolated end-organ \npathology. Three clinical vignettes are presented to illustrate the translational relevance of this \nmodel.

While traditionally managed in silos by distinct medical specialties, \nemerging research uncovering high rates of co-occurrence and overlapping pathophysiology \nchallenges this dichotomy and highlights their interdependence [1-8]. Conditions such as AF and \nHF are now recognized not only as contributors to vascular dementia and cognitive decline but \nalso as active players in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like AD and PD. Likewise, \nneurodegeneration may influence cardiac health through autonomic dysregulation, altered circadian \nrhythms, and systemic inflammation. These new observations suggest the presence of a new type of \ndisease-disease interactions (DDIs): reciprocal complications [8].\nThe recognition of overlapping molecular drivers\u2014such as mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic \ninflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired proteostasis\u2014suggests that these disorders should not \nbe viewed in isolation. Rather, they represent interconnected nodes within a broader aging-related \nnetwork. Increasing evidence suggests that molecular signals originating in one organ actively \ninfluence pathology in the other. The concept of interactomes\u2014complex networks of tissue-to-tissue \nmolecular communication\u2014offers a more accurate model for understanding these bidirectional \ninterfaces or reciprocal complications [8]. Instead of attributing comorbidity to coincidence, \ninteractomes point to causative reciprocity. Understanding and intervening in these cross-talk \nmechanisms may redefine prevention and treatment of both cardiovascular and neurodegenerative \ndiseases. This systems-level perspective opens new avenues for early diagnosis, shared biomarkers, \nand therapeutics that transcend traditional boundaries."

Cognitive testing shows \nreduced verbal recall and executive slowing.\nThis case exemplifies a common clinical observation: the co-\noccurrence of AF and cognitive decline without a clear ischemic event. \nTraditional explanations focus on hypoperfusion and microemboli. \nHowever, recent studies reveal that cardiokines such as growth \ndifferentiation factor-15 (GDF15) and natriuretic peptides, released \nduring cardiac stress, can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where \nthey may influence neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity [9-12]. \nGDF15, in particular, has been linked to hippocampal dysfunction, \nmicroglial activation, and accelerated brain atrophy [13,14]. Rather \nthan simple vascular consequences, the cardiocerebral dialogue itself \nmay be pathogenic.\nEpidemiological studies show that even short episodes of \nsubclinical AF increase the risk of cognitive decline. Furthermore, \noral anticoagulation\u2014while effective for stroke prevention\u2014does \nnot fully abrogate the risk of dementia, suggesting non-embolic \nmechanisms at play. Monitoring and managing AF in patients with \nearly cognitive symptoms may represent a key opportunity for \nneuroprotection.\nInteractomes: Defining the Molecular \nMessengers\nAn interactome is not a single molecule but a system of cross-\norgan messengers [15-19] (Figure 1). These include:\n\u2022\t Cardiokines: Proteins secreted by stressed myocardium \n(e.g., ANP, BNP, GDF15, FGF21) with systemic effects [20-25].\n\u2022\t Neurokines: Brain-derived factors (e.g., brain-derived \nneurotrophic factor BDNF, nerve growth factor NGF) affecting \ncardiac autonomic function and myocardial plasticity [26,27].\n\u2022\t Exosomes and extracellular vehicles (EVs): Lipid-bound \nvehicles carrying noncoding RNAs, proteins, and metabolites from \none organ to another.\n\u2022\t Neurohormonal signals: Feedback circuits involving the \nrenin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS), hypothalamic\u2013\npituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis, and autonomic networks.\nThese interactomes operate in a dynamic, adaptive feedback loop, \nleading to reciprocal complications [8] (Figure  1). Cardiac injury \nalters central neuroimmune tone; neurodegeneration shifts cardiac \nelectrophysiology and vascular tone. The interactome is, in essence, \nthe molecular bloodstream of systems medicine.\nCardiokines in Neurodegeneration\nCardiac tissue under stress secretes a range of proteins that can \nimpact the central nervous system:\n\u2022\t Natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP): Traditionally known for \nvolume regulation, BNP receptors are expressed in the hippocampus \nand cortex. Chronic BNP elevation is associated with cognitive \nimpairment and reduced hippocampal volume [20-22].\n\u2022\t GDF15: A marker of cardiovascular strain and \ninflammation, GDF15 has been implicated in appetite suppression, \nmitochondrial dysfunction, and cognitive frailty [23,24].\n\u2022\t FGF21: A metabolic hormone with cardioprotective effects \nthat also influences neurovascular coupling and neurogenesis [25].\nThese cardiokines can traverse the BBB, modulate astrocyte \nfunction, and influence neural plasticity. In chronic cardiovascular \nstress, this becomes maladaptive, contributing to cognitive decline \nand neurodegeneration.\nNeurokines in Cardiac Remodeling\nJust as the heart can speak to the brain, the brain signals back:\n\u2022\t BDNF: While essential for synaptic health, BDNF also \nregulates heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity. Low \ncirculating BDNF predicts both dementia and incident heart failure \n[26,27].\n\u2022\t NGF: Crucial for sympathetic nervous system development, \nNGF also modulates cardiac remodeling and ischemic tolerance \n[28,29].\n\u2022\t Neuregulin-1 (NRG1): Released by neurons and glial cells, \nNRG1 has protective effects on cardiomyocytes, promoting survival \nand attenuating hypertrophy [30,31].\nIn neurodegenerative diseases, these neurokines are often \ndeficient or dysfunctional. This not only exacerbates neural loss but \nmay compromise cardiac homeostasis\u2014especially under stress.\nExosomes and Microvehicles: The Molecular \nMail Carriers\n\u2022\t Extracellular vehicles (EVs), particularly exosomes, are \nincreasingly recognized as mediators of heart-brain communication \n[32,33]. Originating from endosomal compartments, exosomes carry \nmicroRNAs (miRNAs), proteins, and lipids. Key features:Cardiac-\nderived exosomes in HF carry inflammatory miRNAs (e.g., miR-\nFigure 1: Bidirectional Interactomes Linking the Heart and Brain in \nAging-Related Disease. This conceptual diagram illustrates the reciprocal \nmolecular communication between cardiovascular and neurodegenerative \nsystems. The heart (left) and brain (right) are connected by a bidirectional \n\u201cinteractome\u201d comprising cardiokines, neurokines, exosomes, and \nneurohormonal signals. Cardiokines such as natriuretic peptides, GDF-15, \nand FGF21, released during cardiac stress (e.g., atrial fibrillation, heart \nfailure), may influence neural plasticity, inflammation, and cognitive decline. \nConversely, neurokines including BDNF, NGF, and neuregulin-1, secreted \nfrom neural tissues, regulate autonomic tone and cardiac remodeling. \nExosomes serve as molecular shuttles carrying noncoding RNAs and \nproteins between organs. Neurohormonal circuits (e.g., RAAS, HPA axis) \nfurther integrate systemic signaling. Together, these interactomes represent \na dynamic cross-organ network driving bidirectional pathology across heart \nand brain in Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and cardiovascular disease."

Holter monitoring reveals paroxysmal AF. Plasma \nNT-proBNP and GDF-15 are elevated. CSF shows mild tau pathology. \nDespite anticoagulation, his memory continues to decline.\nThis case challenges the stroke-centric view of AF in dementia. \nAF-related cardiokines may accelerate neurodegeneration through \nnon-thrombotic mechanisms. Monitoring these interactome markers \nmay guide therapy even when ischemic burden is absent.\nConclusion: A New Era of Systems \nIntegration\nThe traditional dichotomy between cardiovascular and \nneurodegenerative disease is dissolving. Interactomes\u2014dynamic \nsignaling networks involving cardiokines, neurokines, EVs, and \nhormonal feedback\u2014drive pathology across organs leading to \nreciprocal complications [8]. These organ cross-talk or DDI \nmechanisms not only explain comorbidity but offer new diagnostic \nwindows and therapeutic strategies. Rather than managing disease \nat its end stages, we must intervene at the molecular conversations \nbetween organs or between diseases. This shift\u2014from fragmentation \nto integration\u2014is the future of translational aging medicine.\nFunding Source\nThis work was supported by the Guangdong Provincial \nDepartment of Education (2024KSYS006) to Zhiguo Wang. \nAuthor Contributions \nWang Z conceptualized the work and drafted the manuscript. \nJu J refined the concept and performed editing, polishing, and \nFigure 2: Functional Map of Bidirectional Interactomes Linking Heart \nand Brain. This schematic illustrates the molecular and cellular pathways \nthrough which the heart and brain communicate in aging-related diseases. \nCardiovascular conditions such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure trigger \nthe release of cardiokines (GDF15, FGF21, BNP) and exosomes containing \nregulatory microRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-146a). These factors cross the \nblood-brain barrier and modulate neuroglial function, leading to astrocyte and \nmicroglial activation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Conversely, \nneurodegenerative processes (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s) influence \ncardiac function via altered autonomic ganglia signaling and neurokine \ndeficiency, promoting cardiac remodeling and arrhythmia susceptibility. \nExosomes and neurohormonal feedback loops integrate these inter-organ \nsignals, forming a dynamic interactome that drives bidirectional disease \nprogression."

Large thrombi are \nassociated with increased morbidity and mortality, posing significant therapeutic challenges [1]. \nWe present the case of a 68-year-old male with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction \n(HFrEF), chronic coronary syndrome, and multiple prior percutaneous coronary interventions \n(PCI), who developed a large left ventricular thrombus alongside acute hepatic and renal failure.\nThe patient was admitted in critical condition due to worsening heart failure, reporting \nprogressive dyspnea and a decline in exercise tolerance over two weeks. Four days before admission, \nhe developed petechial skin lesions. On examination, he presented with cachexia, jaundice, \nconfusion, and hypotension. Laboratory tests indicated severe hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin \n5.2 mg/dL, ALT 311 U/L, AST 322 U/L), renal impairment (creatinine 3.9 mg/dL, eGFR 15 mL/\nmin), thrombocytopenia (platelet count 140 x10\u2079/L), and an elevated INR of 4.33 despite no vitamin \nK antagonist therapy. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction (EF 20%) and a massive thrombus (59 \u00d7 29 mm) occupying half of the ventricular \ncavity. (Figure A, B, )\nGiven the hemodynamic instability and hepatic dysfunction, standard heart failure medications \nwere discontinued, and anticoagulation with enoxaparin was initiated at 40 mg twice daily, later \nincreased to 60 mg after an improvement in renal function. Supportive measures, including \nhepatoprotective therapy and volume resuscitation, were implemented. Follow-up echocardiography \nafter four days demonstrated partial thrombus resolution, with a fragmented mass reduced to 17 \nmm. (Fig.D) Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) confirmed the presence of an apical thrombus and \nexcluded left ventricular wall rupture.\nDespite transient hepatic and renal improvement, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated due \nto refractory hypotension that required norepinephrine and oliguria that was unresponsive to \nFigure 1:"

Most cases are associated with a mass, \nwhich is often malignant. This case highlights the diagnostic and surgical management of a patient \npresenting with ileocecal intussusception secondary to a metastatic low-grade appendiceal mucinous \nneoplasm (LAMN).\nCase Presentation: A 55-year-old male patient was referred to our emergency department with \nright lower abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed an ileocecal \nintussusception, and a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed due to a cystic lesion at \nthe cecum. Following resection, improved exposure revealed multiple mucinous peritoneal foci, \nsuggestive of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Histopathology confirmed the presence of LAMN with \nperitoneal metastasis, consistent with pseudomyxoma peritonei. After an uneventful recovery, the \npatient was subsequently referred to cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal \nchemotherapy (HIPEC), as decided during multidisciplinary tumor board meeting (MDT).\nConclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high level of suspicion for \nmalignancy in cases of intestinal intussusception in adults.

In more than 70% of these adult cases, an underlying pathological lesion \u2013 \neither benign or malignant \u2013 alters normal peristalsis and serves as a lead point for the telescoping \nof the bowel segment [1-3]. \nOne such cause is a mucinous neoplasm of the appendix. These tumors may exert a mass effect \nor distort the local bowel architecture. While often asymptomatic, they may also present with acute \nsymptoms caused by mechanical complication such as obstruction or segmental bowel telescoping \n[1,4].\nMucinous neoplasms of the appendix are very rare, identified in approximately 0.13% of all \nappendectomy specimens [5]. Histologically, they are characterized by dysplastic mucinous \nepithelium confined to the muscularis propria, without infiltrative growth, destructive invasion or \nstromal desmoplasia. Based on cytologic features, they are classified as either low-grade appendiceal \nmucinous neoplasms (LAMN) or high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (HAMN) [6]. \nWhen these tumors perforate and mucin spreads throughout the peritoneal cavity, the condition \nis known as pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) and usually consistent with an advanced stage and \npossible high mortality [6]. \nClinical presentation of LAMN ranges from asymptomatic cases to acute right lower quadrant \npain mimicking appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, or even gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to \nintussusception [1,4].\nImaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), \nor ultrasound may suggest an appendiceal mucocele, but cannot reliably differentiate benign"

However, radiologic features such as wall \ncalcification, irregular contours, and soft tissue thickening are more \nindicative of neoplasia [7].\nHistopathological assessment remains essential for definitive \ndiagnosis and therapeutic planning [8]. Depending on intraoperative \nfindings, specimens may be obtained via appendectomy, partial \ncecectomy, or right hemicolectomy specimen [9]. In cases of \nconfirmed peritoneal dissemination referral to a specialized center \nfor cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic \nintraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) should be considered [10]. \nCase Presentation\nA 55-year-old male presented to his family physician with \ncramp-like pain in the right lower abdomen persisting for four days, \naccompanied by narrow, pencil-shaped stools without hematochezia. \nCT of the abdomen demonstrated an ileocecal intussusception, with \nthe distal ileum and thickened cecal wall prolapsing into the ascending \ncolon (Figure 1). Free peritoneal fluid was noted in the right paracolic \ngutter and pelvis, along with enlarged lymph nodes in the ileocecal \nregion. No signs of bowel perforation or pathologic bowel dilation \nwere observed.\nUpon referral to our emergency department, the patient was \nhemodynamically stable and afebrile, though he appeared generally \nunwell. Physical examination revealed marked epigastric tenderness \non palpation and percussion, a soft abdomen, and reduced bowel \nsounds. Laboratory studies showed elevated inflammatory markers: \nC-reactive protein (CRP) level at 33.5 mg/L and a leukocytosis \nwith a white blood cell count of 14.4 G/L. Hemoglobin (151 g/L), \nplatelet count (324 G/L), renal function, and electrolytes were within \nnormal limits. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was also within the \nreference range (3.46 \u00b5g/L; reference: < 5.2 \u00b5g/L).\nFollowing admission, a colonoscopy was performed. It revealed \na submucosal bulge with intact mucosa and focal livid discoloration \nat the cecum (Figure 2), suggestive for intussusception with an \nunderlying mass. Endoscopic reduction of the intussusception was \nnot feasible. The terminal ileum and remaining colon appeared \nunremarkable. A solitary polyp in the transverse colon was removed \nvia cold snare; histology later confirmed no dysplasia or malignancy.\nSubsequently a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed which \nshowed no hepatic or peritoneal metastases in the initial exploration. \nAlthough the intussusception was not directly visualized, a cystic \nlesion at the cecum was identified (Figure 3). Given the suspicion of \nneoplasm, a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with stapled side-to-\nside anastomosis with curative intent was undertaken.\nUpon improved exposure following hemicolectomy, multiple \nsmall mucinous implants were detected in the greater omentum and \nright upper peritoneum (Figure 4), corresponding to a Sugarbaker \nPeritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) score of 9. PCI is a standardized \nquantitative scoring system used to assess the tumor burden of \nperitoneal carcinomatous by dividing the abdominal and pelvic \ncavity into 13 regions and assigning lesion size score (ranging from 0 \nto 3) based on the largest tumor implant in each region resulting in a \nmaximum PCI of 39 [11]. Several biopsies of the implants were taken.\nPostoperative recovery was uneventful, with early return to \nbowel function. And histopathology then revealed LAMN with \ntransmural extension and serosal perforation (Figure 5), along with \nperifocal abscess formation. Abundant acellular mucin was found \non the serosa, at the cecal pole, and in peritoneal biopsies. Resection \nmargins were tumor-free. Resulting in a final pathological tumor \nstage according to the TNM-classification of pT4a pM1a, which is \nconsistent with a PMP.\nThe case was discussed at the multidisciplinary team meeting \n(MDT) in collaboration with the tertiary referral hospital, and \nFigure 1: Coronal (left) and axial (right) contrast-enhanced CT images of the \nabdomen showing ileocecal intussusception.

Preoperative staging with a thoracic CT scan revealed no \ncontraindication to surgery.\nThree months later, the patient was referred to the specialized \ncenter for definitive treatment and underwent the planned procedure \nwith CRS and HIPEC. This included total parietal peritonectomy, \ncomplete mesenteric tumor debulking, omentectomy (minima and \nmajora), and resection of a small bowel segment approximately 180 \ncm distal to the ligament of Treitz, followed by a stapled side-to-side \nanisoperistaltic ileo-ileal anastomosis. HIPEC was performed for 60 \nminutes at 43.5\u00b0C using mitomycin (30 mg/m\n2 body surface area; \ntotal 72.3 mg) and doxorubicin (15 mg/m 2 body surface area; total \n36.2 mg).\nOnce again, the patient recovered well and was in good clinical \ncondition at one-month follow-up with Grade I (mild) postoperative \ncomplication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb \naccording to the Clavien Dindo Scale of Surgical Complications. \nSubsequently treatment with Rivaroxaban was initiated.\nDiscussion\nThis case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of \nan advanced stage of appendiceal mucinous neoplasm presenting with \nileocecal intussusception. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance \nof timely surgical exploration as intussusception in adults is most \ncommonly associated with underlying neoplastic processes [1-3].\nIf LAMN is suspected preoperatively, a contrast-enhanced MRI \nor contrast-enhances CT scan of the abdomen should be performed \n[12]. In our case, the latter was carried out, however not because of \na suspected LAMN but for primary diagnostic investigation. The \nassessment then did not bring up further suspicion for peritoneal \nimplants.\nThen, in case of suspected LAMN and already radiographically \nconfirmed disseminated peritoneal disease, patients do not require \nan appendectomy for diagnostic purposes, unless they present with \nappendicitis or intussusception. If so, diagnosis is established via \npercutaneous biopsy of a peritoneal lesion, with the histologic grade \nguiding the initial treatment strategy [10,13].\nOnce the diagnosis of LAMN is established, a screening \ncolonoscopy should be performed prior to definitive treatment to \nexclude synchronous colorectal neoplasms [12]. In our case, due \nto the radiological pictured intussusception, this was performed \npreoperatively and prior to the diagnosis of LAMN and revealed no \nsynchronous intraluminal neoplasms except for a benign polyp.\nAccording to current guidelines [12], for localized, non-\nperforated LAMN (pTis or pT3 tumors according to the TNM-\nclassification), complete resection with negative margins (R0 status) \nvia standard appendectomy is generally sufficient, provided there \nis no extra-appendiceal spread or lymph node involvement. Prior \nbiopsy should be avoided due to the risk of tumor perforation. As \nsuch, patients with LAMN staged as pT4a or pT4b according to \nthe TNM-classification without intraperitoneal mucin and with \ncomplete resection (R0) do not require extensive surgery and should \nbe managed with surveillance.\nMore extensive resections, such as right hemicolectomy, are no \nlonger routinely recommended and should be reserved for selected \ncases with cecal wall invasion, lymphovascular spread, or high-grade \nhistology [9,12]. \nConsequently, in regional hospitals, the surgical approach in \nsuch unclear cases should prioritize oncological safety while avoiding \novertreatment. This includes limited resection (appendectomy \nor ileocecectomy), combined with thorough exploration of the \nperitoneal cavity, documentation of PCI, and biopsy of any suspicious \nperitoneal lesions to guide further management and referral. \nDefinitive treatment with CRS and HIPEC is reserved for patients \nwith confirmed peritoneal dissemination and should be carries out \nin hospital with expertise [12,14,15]. Therefore, in cases of confirmed \nperitoneal mucinous spread \u2013 as in our case \u2013 early collaboration with \nthe tertiary referral hospital through MDT is essential.\nIn relation to our case, a hemicolectomy was performed with \ncurative intent, as a cystic, neoplasm-suspect mass with unclear \nmargins was identified intraoperatively at the base of the cecum. The \ndecisive factor was that the peritoneal implants only became apparent \nafter the hemicolectomy due to limited intraoperative visibility.\nRetrospectively and according to the guidelines, a purely \ndiagnostic procedure with biopsy of the peritoneal implants for \nhistologic confirmation would have been a suitable option, as \nthe patient did not present with an acute abdomen and during \nintraoperative exploration, a continual intussusception could not \nhave been confirmed. Therefore, CRS with HIPEC could have been \narranged promptly at a specialized center.\nFor patient with non-perforated LAMN confined to the appendix \n(TNM stage pTis) complete resection is associated with a negligible \nrisk of recurrence, and routine postoperative surveillance is generally \nnot necessary [16]. In contrast, patients with LAMN staged pT4a or \nhigher require surveillance at six-month intervals for a period of five \nyears. In selected cases, extended follow-up beyond this timeframe \nmay be indicated, depending on individual risk factors and clinical \njudgement [12].\nConclusion\nThis case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index \nof suspicion for underlying malignancy in adult patients presenting \nwith intestinal intussusception. It also demonstrates the pivotal role \nof histopathological analysis in guiding postoperative management. \nEarly recognition, combined with a multidisciplinary treatment \napproach, is critical to achieving favorable outcomes in similar \nclinical scenarios.\nFigure 5:  Histopathological image (hematoxylin and eosin stain, 20 \u00d7 \nmagnification) showing low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) \nwith dyplastic mucinous epithelium, characterized by mildly enlarged, \nhyperchromatic nuclei and abundant extracellular mucin."

This retrospective study aimed to analyze the vomiting features in \nmiddle-aged patients with intestinal obstruction and explore their associations with etiology, disease \nprogression, and treatment outcomes. \nMethods: Data from 100 middle-aged patients (aged 40 - 59 years) diagnosed with intestinal \nobstruction and admitted to a single tertiary hospital between 2021 and 2024 were retrospectively \nreviewed. Information on vomiting frequency, content, onset time, associated symptoms, medical \nhistory, treatment methods, and outcomes was collected. Statistical analyses were performed to \nidentify correlations between vomiting characteristics and other clinical variables.\nResults: Vomiting occurred in 78% (78/100) of middle-aged patients. Patients with small bowel \nobstruction had a higher frequency of bilious vomiting (68%, 46/68) compared to those with \nlarge bowel obstruction (22%, 7/32, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that high vomiting \nfrequency (\u22654 times/day, OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2 - 5.3, p = 0.021), bilious vomiting (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: \n1.1 - 4.2, p = 0.033), and a history of abdominal surgery (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.4 - 6.8, p = 0.005) were \nindependent risk factors for poor prognosis.\nConclusion: Vomiting characteristics in middle-aged patients with intestinal obstruction are \nclosely related to the disease's nature and prognosis. Recognizing these features can assist in early \nassessment and guide more targeted treatment strategies.\nKeywords: Middle-aged patients; Intestinal obstruction; Vomiting; Prognosis; Retrospective \nanalysis; Abdominal surgery\nHouhong Wang* \nDepartment of General Surgery, The Affiliated Bozhou Hospital of Anhui Medical University, China\nOPEN ACCESS\n *Correspondence:\nHouhong Wang, Department of General \nSurgery, The Affiliated Bozhou Hospital \nof Anhui Medical University, China,\nE-mail: whh6366@163.com\nReceived Date: 16 Jun 2025\nAccepted Date: 30 Jun 2025\nPublished Date: 01 Jul 2025\nCitation: \nHouhong Wang.

Vomiting, as a common symptom of intestinal obstruction, can have a substantial \nimpact on the patient's condition and treatment outcomes [2]. However, research on the \ncharacteristics of vomiting in middle-aged patients with intestinal obstruction and its relationship \nwith various clinical factors is relatively scarce. This study aimed to conduct a retrospective analysis \nto explore these aspects and provide evidence for clinical practice.\nMaterials and Methods\nPatient selection\nOne hundred middle-aged patients (aged 40 - 59 years) diagnosed with intestinal obstruction \nand admitted to a single tertiary hospital from January 2021 to December 2024 were included. The \ndiagnosis was confirmed by clinical symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, abdominal \ndistension), physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies (abdominal X-ray, CT \nscan). Exclusion criteria were incomplete medical records and a history of chronic gastrointestinal \ndiseases that could interfere with the assessment of vomiting.\nData collection\nData were retrieved from the hospital's electronic medical records.

Patient \ndemographics, medical history (especially previous abdominal \nsurgeries), etiology of intestinal obstruction, treatment methods \n(surgical or conservative), and outcomes (recovery, recurrence, \ncomplications, death) were also collected.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages \nand compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. \nContinuous variables were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or \nmedian (interquartile range) and compared using the t-test or Mann-\nWhitney U test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression \nanalyses were performed to identify factors associated with poor \nprognosis (defined as the need for repeated surgeries, development \nof severe complications, or death). Odds ratios (OR) with 95% \nconfidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Statistical significance was \nset at p < 0.05, and all analyses were conducted using SPSS software \n(version 28.0). \nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nThe study cohort included 55 males (55%) and 45 females (45%), \nwith a mean age of 49.5 \u00b1 5.2 years. The main etiologies of intestinal \nobstruction were adhesive obstruction (35%, 35/100), colorectal \ncancer (25%, 25/100), and hernia-related obstruction (20%, 20/100). \nThe baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.\nVomiting characteristics\nVomiting was observed in 78% (78/100) of patients. The mean \ntime from symptom onset to first vomiting was 6.8 \u00b1 3.0 hours. Non-\nbilious vomiting was reported in 40% (31/78) of vomiting patients, \nbilious vomiting in 55% (43/78), and feculent vomiting in 5% (4/78). \nThe mean vomiting frequency was 3.3 \u00b1 1.6 times per day. The \ndistribution of vomiting characteristics is shown in Table 2.\nRelationship between vomiting characteristics and \ndisease severity\nPatients with small bowel obstruction had a significantly higher \nproportion of bilious vomiting (68%, 46/68) compared to those with \nlarge bowel obstruction (22%, 7/32, p < 0.001). Feculent vomiting was \nmore often associated with severe obstruction cases. The comparison \nof vomiting characteristics among different groups is shown in Table \n3.\nFactors associated with poor prognosis\nUnivariate analysis showed that high vomiting frequency \n(\u22654 times/day), bilious vomiting, feculent vomiting, a history of \nabdominal surgery, and colorectal cancer-related obstruction were \nassociated with poor prognosis. Multivariate logistic regression \nidentified high vomiting frequency (\u22654 times/day, OR = 2.5, 95% CI: \n1.2 - 5.3, p = 0.021), bilious vomiting (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1 - 4.2, \np = 0.033), and a history of abdominal surgery (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: \n1.4 - 6.8, p = 0.005) as independent risk factors for poor prognosis \n(Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThis retrospective study focused on the characteristics of \nvomiting in middle-aged patients with intestinal obstruction. The \nhigh prevalence of vomiting in our cohort indicates its importance \nas a key symptom in this population [3]. The significant differences \nin vomiting content between small and large bowel obstruction \nsuggest that vomiting characteristics can provide valuable clues for \ndifferentiating the location of obstruction.\nHigh vomiting frequency, bilious vomiting, and a history of \nabdominal surgery were identified as independent risk factors for \npoor prognosis. High - frequency vomiting can lead to rapid fluid \nand electrolyte loss, and bilious vomiting may imply a more complex \npathological process in the small intestine [4]. A history of abdominal \nsurgery often leads to adhesions, which are a common cause of \nintestinal obstruction and can make treatment more difficult [5].\nHowever, this study has limitations. The single - center design \nmay introduce selection bias, and the retrospective nature of the \nstudy may affect the accuracy of data collection. Future multicenter, \nprospective studies are needed to validate these findings.\nConclusion\nVomiting characteristics play an important role in the assessment \nof middle-aged patients with intestinal obstruction. By recognizing \nthese characteristics, clinicians can better evaluate the severity of the \nCharacteristics Total (n = 100)\nMean Age (years) 49.5 \u00b1 5.2\nMale Sex (%) 55 (55/100)\nAdhesive Obstruction (%) 35 (35/100)\nColorectal Cancer - related Obstruction (%) 25 (25/100)\nHernia - related Obstruction (%) 20 (20/100)\nHistory of Abdominal Surgery (%) 42 (42/100)\nMean Time from Symptom Onset to Admission (hours) 15.6 \u00b1 7.8\nTable 1: Baseline Characteristics of Middle-aged Patients.\nVomiting Characteristics Number (%)\nVomiting Present 78 (78)\nMean Time to First Vomiting (hours) 6.8 \u00b1 3.0\nNon - Bilious Vomiting 31/78 (40)\nBilious Vomiting 43/78 (55)\nFeculent Vomiting 4/78 (5)\nMean Vomiting Frequency (times/day) 3.3 \u00b1 1.6\nTable 2: Distribution of Vomiting Characteristics in Middle-aged Patients.\nVariables Small Bowel \nObstruction (n = 68)\nLarge Bowel \nObstruction (n = 32) p - value \nBilious Vomiting (%) 68 (46/68) 22 (7/32) < 0.001\nFeculent Vomiting \n(%) 6 (4/68) 0 (0/32) 0.043\nTable 3: Comparison of Vomiting Characteristics among Different Groups.\nVariables Univariate OR \n(95% CI)\np - \nvalue \nMultivariate OR \n(95% CI)\np - \nvalue \nHigh Vomiting Frequency \n(\u22654 times/day) 3.0 (1.3 - 6.9) 0.009 2.5 (1.2 - 5.3) 0.021\nBilious Vomiting 2.8 (1.2 - 6.5) 0.017 2.1 (1.1 - 4.2) 0.033\nFeculent Vomiting 4.5 (1.1 - 18.6) 0.036 1.8 (0.4 - 8.3) 0.43\nHistory of Abdominal \nSurgery 3.8 (1.7 - 8.5) 0.001 3.1 (1.4 - 6.8) 0.005\nColorectal Cancer - related \nObstruction 3.2 (1.3 - 7.9) 0.011 1.9 (0.8 - 4.5) 0.14\nTable 4: Factors Associated with Poor Prognosis in Middle-aged Patients."

It typically presents with intermittent high spiking fever, arthritis/arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, \nevanescent rash, sore throat and other symptoms. AOSD and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis \n(sJIA) are terms that refer to a common clinical condition that can present at different ages. AOSD \nis used to describe patients who are diagnosed after 16yrs, while sJIA is used to describe patients \nwho are diagnosed at or before 16 years. Exact aetiology is unclear; however, it is postulated that \nan external, and in most cases infectious, trigger is required to provoke an aberrant inflammatory \nresponse in genetically susceptible individuals leading to the disease [1,3,4]. AOSD is a diagnosis \nof exclusion and patients must fulfil the Yamaguchi criteria for diagnosis and exclude infections, \nmalignancy and other rheumatological conditions.\nCase Presentation\nA 57-year-old Caucasian male had presented with lethargy, flu-like symptoms, feeling hot and \ncold with profuse night sweats for 5 weeks. He had polyarticular joint pain, unexplained weight loss \nof 5 kg in 1 month and a rash on his chest and back that he said was getting better. He was having \nhigh grade fever daily for 3 weeks and was taking paracetamol. He was normally fit and well, but the \nlethargy and joint pains had almost made him bedridden.  Past history of osteoarthritis in right hip. \nHe had travel history to Benidorm 3 months back. Heterosexual and last sexual encounter 10 years \nback. Nonsmoker, no use of recreational drugs. Physical examination had revealed chest to be clear, \nCVS S1, S2+, no added sounds, abdomen- soft, non-tender, no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy \nand no urinary symptoms. He had tenderness on his right hip joint, and he was unable to complete \nfist with palms and some swelling was noted in his hands- PIP joints of index and middle fingers of \nright hand. No clinical synovitis. He had a blanching rash on his chest and back.\nHis initial bloods had shown CRP 189 mg/L, Total bilirubin 8 umol/L, ALT 53 iu/L, ALP 599 \niu/L, GGT 619 iu/L,Total protein 65 g/L, Albumin 32 g/L, Hb 98 g/L, WBC 13.7 109/L, Plt 400 109/L, \nHCT 0.295 L/L, MCV 87.9 fl, Neutrophils 12.5 10 9/L, Lymphocytes 0.7 10 9/L, U&E were normal. \nESR 112 mm/h and Ferritin >7500 ug/L.\nHe was initially managed on the lines of fever of unknown origin with broad spectrum \nantibiotics. He however continued to spike temperature daily. Infective causes were looked at with \nRepeated blood cultures which were negative. Urine c/s was negative. Chest X ray was normal. \nHepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, CMV, EBV, Toxoplasma, T. pallidum, Leptospira, Q fever, Malaria \nscreen and blood film were all negative. TB QuantiFERON was indeterminate. \nMalignancy was looked for with Protein electrophoresis which did not show any discrete bands \nand Kappa/lambda ratio was normal. Ultrasound neck did not reveal any lymph nodes. CT Thorax, \nabdomen and pelvis was done which was essentially normal and did not show any enlarged lymph \nnodes or deep-seated infection.

Yamaguchi criteria are commonly used to diagnose \nAOSD and requires at least 5 criteria to be fulfilled, >=2 of it must \nbe major criteria and any infection, malignancy or rheumatological \ncondition that can mimic AOSD must be excluded [5].\nYamaguchi criteria [5]\nMajor criteria:\n\u2022\t Fever of at least 39\u2019C lasting for at least 1 week\n\u2022\t Arthralgia or arthritis lasting for >=2 weeks\n\u2022\t A non-pruritic macular or maculopapular skin rash over \ntrunk or extremities during febrile episodes\n\u2022\t Leucocytosis >=10000/microlitre with at least 80% \ngranulocytes\nMinor criteria:\n\u2022\t Sore throat\n\u2022\t Lymphadenopathy\n\u2022\t Hepatomegaly or Splenomegaly\n\u2022\t Abnormal liver function test\n\u2022\t Negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) and rheumatoid \nfactor (RF)\nOther criteria used to diagnose AOSD without the need for \nexclusion criteria is the Fautrel criteria. It requires >=4 major or 3 \nmajor and 2 minor criteria. It requires the testing of glycosylated \nferritin which is not available at many centres and hence is not as \nwidely used as the Yamaguchi criteria.\nFautrel criteria [6]\nMajor criteria:\n\u2022\t Fever >=39\u2019C\n\u2022\t Arthralgias\n\u2022\t Transient erythematous rash\n\u2022\t Pharyngitis\n\u2022\t Polymorphonuclear neutrophils >=80%\n\u2022\t Glycosylated ferritin <=20%\nMinor criteria:\n\u2022\t Maculopapular rash\n\u2022\t Leucocytosis >=10000/microlitre\nPathogenesis of AOSD is unclear with both genetic and \ninfectious triggers being implicated in this autoinflammatory multi \nsystem condition. Some link has been found between HLA gene \npolymorphism and susceptibility to AOSD. The associated HLA \nantigens include- HLA-B17, HLA-B18, HLA-B35, HLA-DR2, \nHLA-DR4, HLA-DRB1*12, HLA-DRB1*15 [1,3,4]. Polymorphism \naffecting the genes for IL-18 and macrophage migration inhibitory \nfactor (MIF) have been postulated to predispose people to AOSD [1].\nThree patterns of clinical course have been identified [7,8]\n1. Monocyclic systemic- consisting of one episode lasting for \na few months followed by remission.\n2. Polycyclic systemic- intermittent flares.\n3. Chronic articular- persistent and progressive symptoms, \nmainly affecting the joints.\nTreatment consists of NSAIDs for symptomatic relief and \nsystemic corticosteroids as a weaning course as first line therapy. \nProton pump inhibitors and bone protection should be prescribed in \nconjunction. If inflammation persists despite corticosteroids or there \nis relapse after tapering of steroids, a steroid sparing agent in the form \nof DMARDs like methotrexate can be used [3]. In refractory AOSD \nbiological agents such as anakinra (IL-1 inhibitor), tocilizumab (IL-6 \ninhibitor) can be used [1,3].\nThe most serious complication of AOSD is macrophage activation \nsyndrome (MAS) which has high mortality. The risk factors for MAS \nare- high clinical disease activity, high serum ferritin, leukopenia and \nraised triglycerides [7]. Treatment consists of intravenous pulse dose \nmethylprednisolone and early use of biologic agents [1,3,4,9].\nConclusion\nAdult onset Still\u2019s disease is a rare condition that can be difficult \nto diagnose as the clinical presentation has a wide differential. A \ndelay in diagnosis of more than 6 months is associated with increased \nrisk of relapses or chronic articular variant of the condition (5) and \nhence patients presenting with pyrexia of unknown origin with \nrash and arthralgia, serum ferritin levels should be considered as \nhyperferritinaemia is seen in 89% patients with AOSD. \nReferences\n1.

The characteristics of vomiting in this population and their associations \nwith disease severity and prognosis remain unclear. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the \nvomiting features in elderly patients with intestinal obstruction and explore their relationships with \netiology, disease progression, and treatment outcomes.\nMethods: Data from 90 elderly patients (aged \u226560 years) diagnosed with intestinal obstruction \nand admitted to a single tertiary hospital between 2021 and 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. \nInformation regarding vomiting frequency, content, onset time, associated symptoms, comorbidities, \ntreatment methods, and outcomes was collected. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify \ncorrelations between vomiting characteristics and other clinical variables.\nResults: Vomiting occurred in 82.2% (74/90) of elderly patients. Patients with strangulated \nobstruction had significantly higher vomiting frequencies (mean 5.8 \u00b1 1.6 times/day) compared to \nthose with simple obstruction (2.3 \u00b1 1.1 times/day, p < 0.001). Feculent vomiting was more prevalent \nin patients with colorectal cancer - related obstruction (21.4%, 6/28) than in other etiological groups. \nMultivariate analysis revealed that feculent vomiting (OR = 4.1, 95% CI: 1.3 - 12.8, p = 0.017), high \nvomiting frequency (\u22655 times/day, OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.4 - 7.8, p = 0.006), and the presence of \n\u22653 comorbidities (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.2 - 7.1, p = 0.023) were independent risk factors for poor \nprognosis.\nConclusion: Vomiting characteristics in elderly patients with intestinal obstruction are closely \nrelated to disease severity and prognosis. Recognizing these features can assist in early risk \nassessment and guide personalized treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.\nKeywords: Elderly patients; Intestinal obstruction; Vomiting; Comorbidities; Prognosis; \nRetrospective analysis\nHouhong Wang* \nDepartment of General Surgery, The Affiliated Bozhou Hospital of Anhui Medical University, China\nOPEN ACCESS\n *Correspondence:\nHouhong Wang, Department of General \nSurgery, The Affiliated Bozhou Hospital \nof Anhui Medical University, China,\nE-mail: whh6366@163.com\nReceived Date: 16 Jun 2025\nAccepted Date: 30 Jun 2025\nPublished Date: 01 Jul 2025\nCitation: \nHouhong Wang.

Vomiting, \na common symptom in intestinal obstruction, can lead to dehydration, electrolyte disorders, and \nrespiratory complications in the elderly, exacerbating the severity of the disease [2]. However, \nthe specific characteristics of vomiting in elderly patients with intestinal obstruction and their \nimpact on prognosis have not been fully explored. This retrospective study aimed to fill this gap by \nanalyzing the relationship between vomiting features and various clinical aspects in elderly patients \nwith intestinal obstruction.\nMaterials and Methods\nPatient Selection\nNinety elderly patients (aged \u226560 years) diagnosed with intestinal obstruction and admitted \nto a single tertiary hospital from January 2021 to December 2024 were included. The diagnosis of \nintestinal obstruction was confirmed by clinical symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests, \nand imaging studies (abdominal X - ray, CT scan). Exclusion criteria were incomplete medical \nrecords and a history of previous intestinal resection that could confound the assessment.\nData collection\nClinical data were retrieved from the hospital's electronic medical records.

Statistical \nsignificance was set at p < 0.05, and all analyses were conducted using \nSPSS software (version 28.0). \nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nThe study cohort consisted of 52 males (57.8%) and 38 females \n(42.2%), with a mean age of 71.5 \u00b1 6.8 years. The main etiologies \nof intestinal obstruction were adhesive obstruction (37.8%, 34/90), \ncolorectal cancer (31.1%, 28/90), and hernia - related obstruction \n(16.7%, 15/90). Most patients had at least one comorbidity, with \n44.4% (40/90) having \u22653 comorbidities. The baseline characteristics \nare shown in Table 1.\nVomiting characteristics\nVomiting was observed in 82.2% (74/90) of patients. The mean \ntime from symptom onset to first vomiting was 7.2 \u00b1 3.6 hours. Non - \nbilious vomiting was reported in 43.2% (32/74) of vomiting patients, \nbilious vomiting in 48.6% (36/74), and feculent vomiting in 8.1% \n(6/74). The mean vomiting frequency was 3.7 \u00b1 1.8 times/day. The \ndistribution of vomiting characteristics is shown in Table 2.\nRelationship between vomiting characteristics and \ndisease severity\nPatients with strangulated obstruction had a significantly higher \nmean vomiting frequency (5.8 \u00b1 1.6 times/day) compared to those \nwith simple obstruction (2.3 \u00b1 1.1 times/day, p < 0.001). Feculent \nvomiting was more common in patients with colorectal cancer - \nrelated obstruction (21.4%, 6/28) than in those with adhesive (2.9%, \n1/34) or hernia - related obstruction (0%, 0/15, p = 0.024). The \ncomparison of vomiting characteristics among different groups is \nshown in Table 3.\nFactors associated with poor prognosis\nUnivariate analysis indicated that feculent vomiting, high \nvomiting frequency (\u22655 times/day), \u22653 comorbidities, advanced \nage (\u226575 years), and colorectal cancer - related obstruction were \nassociated with poor prognosis. Multivariate logistic regression \nidentified feculent vomiting (OR = 4.1, 95% CI: 1.3 - 12.8, p = 0.017), \nhigh vomiting frequency (\u22655 times/day, OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.4 - 7.8, \np = 0.006), and the presence of \u22653 comorbidities (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: \n1.2 - 7.1, p = 0.023) as independent risk factors for poor prognosis \n(Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThis retrospective study focused on vomiting characteristics \nin elderly patients with intestinal obstruction. The high prevalence \nof vomiting in our cohort highlights its significance as a clinical \nsymptom in this population [3]. The differences in vomiting frequency \nand content among different types and severities of obstruction \nsuggest that vomiting features can provide valuable information for \nevaluating the condition of elderly patients.\nFeculent vomiting, often indicating advanced obstruction or \nbowel ischemia, was strongly associated with poor prognosis. In \nelderly patients, feculent vomiting may be more likely to cause \naspiration and subsequent respiratory complications, contributing \nto worse outcomes [4]. High - frequency vomiting can rapidly lead \nto dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which are particularly \ndangerous for the elderly due to their reduced physiological reserve \n[5]. Comorbidities, common in the elderly, can further complicate \nthe management of intestinal obstruction and increase the risk of \nCharacteristics Total (n = 90)\nMean Age (years) 71.5 \u00b1 6.8\nMale Sex (%) 57.8 (52/90)\nAdhesive Obstruction (%) 37.8 (34/90)\nColorectal Cancer - related Obstruction (%) 31.1 (28/90)\nHernia - related Obstruction (%) 16.7 (15/90)\n\u22653 Comorbidities (%) 44.4 (40/90)\nMean Time from Symptom Onset to Admission (hours) 18.2 \u00b1 8.5\nTable 1: Baseline Characteristics of Elderly Patients.\nVomiting Characteristics Number (%)\nVomiting Present 74 (82.2)\nMean Time to First Vomiting (hours) 7.2 \u00b1 3.6\nNon - Bilious Vomiting 32/74 (43.2)\nBilious Vomiting 36/74 (48.6)\nFeculent Vomiting 6/74 (8.1)\nMean Vomiting Frequency (times/day) 3.7 \u00b1 1.8\nTable 2: Distribution of Vomiting Characteristics in Elderly Patients.\nVariables Strangulated Obstruction \n(n = 25)\nSimple \nObstruction \n(n = 65)\np - value \nMean Vomiting \nFrequency (times/day) 5.8 \u00b1 1.6 2.3 \u00b1 1.1 < 0.001\n \nColorectal Cancer - \nrelated Obstruction \n(n = 28)\nOther Etiologies \n(n = 62) p - value \nFeculent Vomiting (%) 21.4 (6/28) 3.2 (2/62) 0.024\nTable 3: Comparison of Vomiting Characteristics among Different Groups.\nVariables Univariate OR \n(95% CI)\np - \nvalue \nMultivariate OR \n(95% CI)\np - \nvalue \nFeculent Vomiting 5.3 (1.6 - 17.5) 0.006 4.1 (1.3 - 12.8) 0.017\nHigh Vomiting Frequency \n(\u22655 times/day) 4.7 (1.9 - 11.6) 0.001 3.3 (1.4 - 7.8) 0.006\n\u22653 Comorbidities 3.8 (1.5 - 9.6) 0.004 2.9 (1.2 - 7.1) 0.023\nAge \u226575 years 2.7 (1.1 - 6.6) 0.032 1.8 (0.7 - 4.6) 0.21\nColorectal Cancer - related \nObstruction 3.1 (1.3 - 7.4) 0.011 2.1 (0.8 - 5.4) 0.12\nTable 4: Factors Associated with Poor Prognosis in Elderly Patients."

However unlike trigger point injections, this \nminimally invasive myofascial nerve injection is performed differently and targets the myofascial \ntissues, peripheral innervations, posterior spinal structures and spinal nerve roots at the same \ntime. It is different from a trigger point injection that aims to block trigger points within a muscle. \nProlonged standing or sitting, posture and other multiple factors can create recurrent injuries \nwith attendant inflammation and episodically aggravate pain. Thus there is a need for a simple \nintervention technique that can be performed from the medical clinic to the battlefield to quickly \nrelieve inflammation and prevent chronic pain.\nIntroduction\nThis myofascial nerve injection is also the first procedure for spine pain since epidural pain \ninjection was first described by Jean-Anasthase Sicard in Paris on April 20 th, 1901 [1,2]. However, \nat about the same time, Fernand Cathelin also from Paris had been treating patients with epidural \ninjections for some months already [3].\nIncidentally, a few months after we published our novel short needle technique for paraspinal \nmuscle block in February 2016 [4,5], the Erector Spinae (ESP) nerve block was described in a \npublication in September 2016, as a regional block for thoracic neuropathic pain [6-8]. The injection \nis performed by a single shot or with a catheter insertion for continuous infusion (5 ml to 14 ml per \nhour) [9,10]. The primary mechanism is thought to be a direct effect of local anesthetic via physical \nspread and diffusion to the erector spinae muscles as well as neural structures in the fascial plane \ndeep to the erector spinae muscles and adjacent tissue compartments [11]. Satisfactory results have \nbeen obtained in the treatment of both acute pain and chronic pain, and in some cases the ESP has \nreplaced the use of epidural injections.\nClear solution of medication injected under pressure from a 30 G 5/8 inch (15.6 mm) needles \ntravel a distance of 4 cm to 6 cm. As described in Sota Omoigui Short Needle Technique [4], utilizing \nthe physics principle of the law of conservation of mass, the increased velocity of the injectate is \nsufficient to traverse the erector spinae muscles to the vertebral lamina and block the posterior \nspinal structures and nerves at the level injected [4]. Compressing the soft tissue with one hand, and \ninjecting 1 ml to 2 ml Lidocaine 2% at the two most painful levels on each side of the vertebra or \nspinous process, we have been able to achieve 60% to 100% of relief of axial and radicular pain within \n5 min. Total dosage of Lidocaine must be below the toxic dose of 3 mg/kg without epinephrine.\nDue to the small size and length of the needle, this technique can be performed not just by \npain specialist but by a primary care physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner or any \nmedical service provider trained to do intramuscular injections. This myofascial nerve block can be \nperformed with or without imaging guidance in a variety of settings from the operating room to the \nmedical clinic to the battlefield.\nThis myofascial nerve block may be used in combination with an anti-inflammatory regimen, \nincluding oral, IV or IM Steroid, Ketorolac/Diclofenac, Opioids, Ketamine, Ketorolac, Magnesium \nSulfate, Kineret, CGRP Blockers, Botulinum Toxin etc. These block or inhibit various inflammatory \nmediators including prostaglandins (steroid, ketorolac/diclofenac), IL-1 Beta (Kineret) NMDA \nreceptors (magnesium sulfate, ketamine), Substance P (Botulinum Toxin) etc [12].\nOmoigui S* and Fadare A\nDepartment of Inflammation and Pain Research, LA Pain Clinic, USA\nOPEN ACCESS\n *Correspondence:\nSota Omoigui, Department of \nInflammation and Pain Research, L.A. \nPain Clinic, 4019 W.

The presence of Substance P and \nother inflammatory proteins such as Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide \n(CGRP) neurokinin A and vasoactive intestinal peptide removes \nmagnesium induced inhibition and enables excitatory inflammatory \nproteins such as glutamate and aspartate to activate specialized spinal \ncord NMDA receptors and increase magnification of the nerve traffic \nand pain stimuli.\nAxial and radicular back pain is symptoms of injury that result in \na cascade of inflammatory mediators. Local anesthetic agents stabilize \nnerve membrane and decrease pain by reducing the rate of discharge \nof sensory nerve fibers and decreasing neurogenic inflammation [16].\nCurrent procedural injections for back, neck and radicular pain \nfocus on structures that are visible with imaging, skeletal system \n(bones, joints, intervertebral discs) and central nervous system (brain \nand spinal cord) components while completely ignoring the largest \norgan in the spine and most often the initial site of injury, which \nare the paraspinal muscles\u2013cervical, thoracic and lumbar. The most \ncommon pain procedures are essentially blind techniques as pain \ntriggers are targeted based upon structural pathology. Unfortunately \nthere is poor correlation between structural pathology and the \npresence of back [17,18] or neck pain [19].\nMyofascial tissues constitute a pain generator that is not \naddressed in current interventional pain procedures. Randomized \ncontrolled studies of current procedures have yielded conflicting \nresults. In a study by Dilke et al., [20] patients who received epidural \ncorticosteroids experienced less pain than controls, needed surgery \nless often and returned back to work sooner. However and on the \ncontrary, Snoek et al., [21] showed that epidural steroid injection \nwas no more effective than a placebo injection in relieving chronic \nsymptoms due to lumbar disc herniation. In 2008, Staal et al. [22] \nreported on a systematic review of the literature conducted with a \nfocus on randomized, controlled trials. Based on their analyses, the \nauthors made the conclusion that there is moderate evidence that \nepidural corticosteroid injections are no more effective than placebo \ninjections for pain relief.\nOther procedures range from transforaminal injections, \nradiofrequency thermal lesioning of the medial branch nerves, \nradiofrequency cryolesioning of the medial branch nerves, intradiscal \nelectrothermy (thermal burn to the intervertebral disc), and spinal cord \nstimulation. Recent randomized control trials have also questioned \nthe effectiveness of these more invasive procedures. A multicenter, \nrandomized, double-blind, sham treatment controlled trial was \nperformed to determine the efficacy of radiofrequency lumbar facet \njoint denervation. In both groups, there was significant improvement \nin the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [23]. In the Mint study, three \nrandomized clinical trials were conducted on the effectiveness of \nminimal interventional treatments for participants with chronic low \nback pain. Radiofrequency denervation combined with a standardized \nexercise program resulted in either no improvement or no clinically \nimportant improvement in chronic low back pain compared with a \nstandardized exercise program alone. In another randomized control \ntrial, assessing the efficacy of Radiofrequency (RF) denervation of the \ncervical facet joints in chronic cervical facet joint pain the authors \nstated that they did not observe significant differences between RF \ndenervation combined with injection of local anesthesia compared \nwith local anesthesia at 6 months follow-up. The need for pain \nmedication did not differ significantly between groups [24]. In another \nrandomized controlled trial, in patients with cervicogenic headache \nthe authors did not find evidence that radiofrequency treatment of \ncervical facet joints was a better treatment than the infiltration of the \ngreater occipital nerve [25].\nIn one study the author stated that the evidence is poor for \ncervical transforaminal epidural injections. Complications with \ncervical interlaminar epidural injections are rare, but more commonly \noccur with transforaminal epidural injections. These can be fatal and \ninclude vertebral artery injury, systemic allergic reactions to radio \ncontrast agents, transient cortical blindness and brain injury [26], \nstroke, paraplegia, quadriplegia, spinal cord and cerebella infarction \n[27,28].\nThese trials raise the issue of questionable benefits, compared to \nsimpler procedures such as our myofascial nerve blockade.\nAs stated in the NIH, HEAL Initiative Fund Opportunity [29], \nthe field of musculoskeletal pain has largely focused on the skeletal \nsystem (bones, joints, intervertebral discs) and central nervous system \n(brain and spinal cord) components. The contribution of myofascial \ntissues, especially fascia, and the interactions of fascia, muscles, and \nperipheral nerves are understudied and remain mostly unknown. Pain \noriginating from muscles and fascia is likely an important component \nof many severe and chronic pain conditions. The perimuscular fascia \nis richly innervated with small-diameter fibers whose receptive fields \nincrease in the presence of inflammation. Thus myofascial tissues \nplay a significant role as pain generators.\nThe NIH noted that for many years, structural imaging was the \nmain tool to guide treatment decisions, including surgery. Meanwhile, \nimaging and other objective measurements of \u201csoft\u201d tissues including \nmuscles, and connective tissues or \u201cfasciae,\u201d were not even considered \nas musculoskeletal pain biomarker candidates. Thus NIH has called \nfor development of biomarkers of myofascial tissues for effective pain \nmanagement regimens.\nIn the last seven years, we have replaced epidural and facet joint/\nnerve injections with a myofascial nerve block. We routinely perform \nmyofascial nerve injections, with or without ultrasound guidance to \nrelieve pain. We had observed during spinal procedures that a clear \nsolution of Lidocaine 2%, injected from a 30G 5/8 inch (15.6 mm) \nneedle, using a 3 ml syringe, and inserted just lateral to the spinous \nprocess, into the paraspinal muscles, traveled a distance of 4cm to \n6 cm [4]. This distance was sufficient to travel through the erector \nspinae muscles down to the vertebral lamina and posterior spinal \nstructures and within minutes produce anesthetic block to relieve \nradicular pain from the nerve roots [4].\nIn the last two years, the advent of erector spinae plane blocks that \nare essentially myofascial blocks but utilizing longer needles inserted \nto the target point, with large volumes of dilute local anesthetic has \nvalidated our original but simpler myofascial nerve block (Figures 1-6"

Since no \nfluid can leave through the walls, the mass crossing each section of the \ntube per unit time must be the same. Therefore the velocity of fluid \nthrough the smaller area is faster than the velocity of the fluid through \nthe larger area. This phenomenon can be explained and quantified by \nexamining the flow rate of mass through the tubing.

When a higher gauge (smaller) needle is used, with a 3 ml \nsyringe, the distance of travel of medication from the syringe and \nneedle into tissue will be greater, because there is increased velocity \nthrough the smaller needle and hence greater penetration of \nmedication into the tissues.\nAdvantages\nClear fluid medications can be injected to traverse and provide \na therapeutic effect at a distance to the needle point e.g. paraspinal \nmuscles and lamina.\nLimitations\nThis targeted structure must be within 6 cm distance and not \nobstructed by bone e.g. a hip or knee joint.\nMyofascial Injection Technique\nWith the Myofascial Injection Technique for Spinal Pain, the \nspine is palpated to locate the most painful sites. A short 30G 5/8 \ninch needle is inserted adjacent to the spinal process or vertebra at \nthe level of those sites. The soft tissue is compressed and the needle \nis advanced just past the subcutaneous tissue into the muscle layer, \nand 1 ml to 2 ml of local anesthetic solution (preferably 2% Lidocaine \nfor most sites) is injected in each site. If performed under ultrasound \nguidance the solution will be seen to spread 4 cm to 6 cm deep into \nthe paraspinal muscle, down to the lamina and posterior spinal \nstructures. The injection is repeated at the 2 to 4 most painful sites, \nkeeping in mind not to exceed the toxic dose of the local anesthetic \n(3 mg/kg). The number of sites injected is limited by the volume and \nconcentration of local anesthetic injected so as not to exceed the toxic \ndose of anesthetic.\nWith the myofascial injection, the soft tissue is compressed and the \nneedle is inserted close to its hub (5/8 in), the medication is injected to \nreach the target site. In most instances, it is no longer necessary to use \nlonger and bigger gauge needles for epidural injections for treatment \nof axial pain and radiculopathy. With a myofascial injection, the \nmedication can be pushed under pressure through the erector spinae \nmuscle to block the posterior spinal structures, using a smaller shorter \nneedle. Use of such a short small bore needle such as the BD 30G \n5/8 inch needle will make myofascial injections much safer as there \nis significantly decreased risk of needle trauma. This technique is also \nuseful in patients who are anti-coagulated. Compression of the skin \nand subcutaneous fatty tissue reduces the distance of travel required \nfor the medication to penetrate through the paraspinal muscle to the \nposterior spinal structures.\nDistances\nClear solution of medication injected under pressure from a 30G \n5/8 inch (15.6 mm) needles travel a distance of 4 cm to 6 cm.\nIn the lumbar spine, the distance from the skin to the ligamentum \nflavum is 3 cm to 8 cm [30-32]. In the upper thoracic spine the distance \nfrom skin to the lamina with a paramedian approach, 1 cm from the \nmidline, is 4.2 cm, middle thoracic spine is 3.7 cm, lower thoracic \nspine is 3.6 cm and lumbar spine is 4.0 cm. The average distance from \nskin to the epidural space with a paramedian approach, 1 cm from the \nmidline, in the upper thoracic spine is 5.6 cm, middle thoracic spine is \n5.2 cm, lower thoracic spine is 4.4 cm and lumbar spine is 4.7 cm [33]. \nThe mean distance from the skin to the transverse processes and facet \njoint articular processes, ranges from 3.2 cm to 5 cm, as measured in a \nstudy utilizing a 3 MHz to 5 MHz ultrasound probe see Figure 8 [34].\nWe have had a variable duration of pain relief from one week to \none year and similar to the epidural steroid and facet nerve injections \nFigure 7: The pipe constricting from area A1 to area A2.\nFigure 8: Mean distances (mm) between skin and transverse processes \n(TPR &TPL) and skin and articular processes (APR & APL) by vertebral level \n(TPR: skin to transverse process at the right side, TPL: skin to transverse \nprocess at the left side, APR: skin to articular process at the right side. APL: \nskin to articular process at the left side).\nIt can therefore be seen that by compressing the soft tissue and shortening \nthe distance, with our technique for procedural injections utilizing a short \nsmall bore needle such as the BD 30G 5/8 inch needle, medication can be \ndelivered at a distance, under pressure, to travel to block pain generators \nincluding peripheral nerves in the muscle, fascia, as well as in the posterior \nspinal structures in including the medial branch nerves, facet joints and \nlumbar nerve roots. This is the first procedural technique that can block \nmultiple pain generators in just one injection."

Hybrid ablation, \nwhich combines thoracoscopic epicardial ablation with endocardial catheter mapping and ablation, \nhas emerged as a promising strategy to enhance arrhythmia control in complex cases [1,2].\nObjective: To systematically review long-term outcomes of hybrid ablation in patients with \npersistent and long-standing persistent AF and to compare its efficacy and safety profile with \nconventional catheter ablation alone.\nMethods: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was conducted \nup to November 2024. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, prospective and \nretrospective cohort studies, and meta-analyses reporting outcomes in hybrid vs. catheter ablation \nfor persistent or long-standing persistent AF. Primary endpoints included maintenance of sinus \nrhythm and freedom from antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs); secondary endpoints included procedural \ncomplications and mortality.\nResults: Thirty studies involving over 1,500 patients were included. Sinus rhythm maintenance after \nhybrid ablation ranged from 70.7% to 89% off AADs at long-term follow-up (mean 19 months), \nsignificantly higher than catheter ablation alone (41\u201349.9%) [3\u20138]. Complication rates were slightly \nhigher in the hybrid group (6.5%), primarily due to bleeding and pericardial effusion, but serious \nadverse events and mortality remained low. Notably, complication rates declined significantly over \ntime with increasing surgical experience [5,7,9].\nConclusions: Hybrid ablation offers superior rhythm control in persistent and long-standing \npersistent AF with an acceptable safety profile. Ongoing randomized trials and standardized \nprocedural protocols are essential to optimize patient selection and procedural efficacy.\nGiulio Tessitore*, Corrado Cavozza, Luca De donno, Giulia Maj and Andrea Audo\nAzienda Ospedaliera santi Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo via Venezia 16 15121 Alessandria, Italy\nOPEN ACCESS\n *Correspondence:\nGiulio Tessitore, Azienda Ospedaliera \nsanti Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo \nvia Venezia 16 15121 Alessandria, Italy, \nTel: 3334982691;\nE-mail: giulio.tessitore@libero.it\nReceived Date: 09 Jun 2025\nAccepted Date: 25 Jun 2025\nPublished Date: 26 Jun 2025\nCitation: \nTessitore G, Cavozza C, De donno L, \nMaj G, Audo A.

Catheter ablation is a cornerstone of rhythm control, especially in \nparoxysmal AF; however, in persistent and long-standing persistent AF, outcomes are limited due \nto complex atrial substrate remodeling [11,12].\nThe Cox-Maze III/IV surgical procedure, while effective, is underutilized due to its invasiveness. \nHybrid ablation, a less invasive approach combining thoracoscopic epicardial ablation and \ncatheterbased endocardial mapping, seeks to achieve durable lesion sets with fewer complications \nand faster recovery [13\u201315].\nMethods\nLiterature Search Strategy\nA systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was conducted using terms \n\"hybrid ablation,\" \"catheter ablation,\" \"persistent atrial fibrillation,\" and \"long-standing persistent \natrial fibrillation.\" Studies were included if they involved adults undergoing either hybrid or catheter \nablation, with reported outcomes on rhythm control, complications, and mortality [16].\nStudy Selection and Data Extraction\nInclusion criteria:\n\u2022\t RCTs, cohort studies, meta-analyses"

Risk of bias was assessed using \nthe Cochrane tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nThirty studies involving over 1,500 patients (38% persistent AF, \n51% long-standing persistent AF) were included. Mean age ranged \nfrom 59\u201369 years. Mean follow-up duration was 19 months. Most \nhybrid ablations were performed in a staged manner (epicardial first, \nendocardial 6\u201312 weeks later) [4,6,7,17] (Tables 1-3).\nEfficacy\nSinus rhythm maintenance rates were consistently higher in the \nhybrid group:\n\u2022\t Without AADs: 70.7% (range 65\u201389%)\n\u2022\t With AADs: up to 79.4%\nSafety\nHybrid ablation had a 6.5% complication rate vs. 4.2% in catheter-\nonly:\n\u2022\t Bleeding: 1.6%\n\u2022\t Pericardial effusion: 1.7%\n\u2022\t Phrenic nerve injury: 1.2%\n\u2022\t Mortality: 0.2%\nRecent trials like CEASE-AF reported declining complication \nrates, supporting improved procedural safety with experience \n[7,9,18].\nTechnical Focus: Thoracoscopic Epicardial \nAblation\nThoracoscopic surgical ablation is performed via bilateral or \nright-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic access, typically using three \nports. Pulmonary vein isolation is achieved using bipolar RF clamps, \nensuring transmural lesions. The posterior wall is then isolated \n(box lesion) and ligament of Marshall dissection is performed in \nmost cases. Left atrial appendage exclusion is often added for stroke \nprevention [14,19].\nAdvantages of the thoracoscopic approach include:\n\u2022\t Direct visualization of anatomic structures\n\u2022\t Ability to perform linear lesions on the posterior wall\n\u2022\t LAA exclusion when indicated\n\u2022\t Lower risk of esophageal injury compared to endocardial \napproaches\nA second-stage endocardial procedure allows for verification \nof conduction block and completion of gaps. Electroanatomical \nmapping ensures durable isolation and addresses residual triggers \n[20,21].\nDiscussion\nHybrid ablation effectively bridges the gap between surgical and \ncatheter-based strategies in AF management. The ability to combine \ntransmural epicardial lesions with precise endocardial mapping \naddresses both the anatomical and electrophysiological substrate of \nadvanced AF [1\u20133,22].\nPatient selection remains key. Ideal candidates include:\n\u2022\t Symptomatic persistent or long-standing persistent AF\n\u2022\t Prior failed catheter ablation\n\u2022\t Left atrial enlargement (>50 mm)\n\u2022\t High fibrosis burden [23,24]\nWhile the learning curve is steep, the increasing experience of \ncenters worldwide is translating into improved outcomes and safety \n[7,18,25].\nStudy n \n(Hybrid)\nn \n(Catheter)\nPersistent AF \n(%)\nLSP-AF \n(%)\nMean Age \n(yrs)\nFollow-up \n(months)\nHARTCAP-AF [4] 74 76 58 42 63 12\nCEASE-AF [7] 83 85 60 40 66 24\nPison et al.

While interface irrigation and debridement typically serve as primary treatments, \nthese methods carry a risk of corneal lamellar flap rupture during debridement - a complication that \ncould significantly compromise visual outcomes. This study presents a novel combined treatment \nstrategy for achieving rapid control of post-SMILE bacterial infections.\nMethods: A retrospective chat review was conducted of interface bacterial infections following \nSMILE treated in our institution between June 2019 and October 2021. Our treatment protocol \nmainly included topical administration and corneal lavage of antibiotics, as well as photoactivated \nchromophore for keratitis-corneal cross-linking (CXL). Key interventions contributing to rapid \neradication of infections were analyzed.\nResults: 7 eyes of four patients with interface bacterial infections following SMILE were treated. All \n7 eyes received topical and corneal lavage of vancomycin/tobramycin. Additionally, 6 eyes received \nCXL and 1 eye interface antibiotic irrigation. Without knowing causal pathogens, continuous lavage \naccelerated the clearance of the infections. Time taken to control the infections in this case series \nranged from 1 to 8 days (median 4 days), and time taken to achieve clinical cure from 5 to 15 days \n(median 7 days), with the best corrected visual acuity \u226520/25 at the last follow-up. \nConclusions: Combining topical antibiotics with continuous corneal lavage can quickly control \ninterface bacterial infections after SMILE and preserve vision. CXL appears to have limited \nadditional therapeutic effect.\nKeywords: Corneal refractive surgery; Post-SMILE infection; Corneal lavage; Corneal cross-\nlinking\nLin Zhao2,3#, Chang Liu1-4#, Mingwu Wang5*, Jie Bai2,3, Ling Li2,3, Zexia Dou2,3, Shaowei Li1-4*\n1Aier Academy of Ophthalmology, Central South University, Changsha, P.R.

Despite increased safety due to smaller incision and minimal invasiveness [2], \ninterface infections can still occur postoperatively. Several case reports of postoperative infection \nafter SMILE have been published in recent years.

This method \ndoes not rely on microbiology identification of the causal pathogens, \ncan be implemented promptly, and often without the need for \ninterface irrigation and debridement.\nCase Presentation\nCase 1\nAn 18-year-old man underwent SMILE on both eyes 4 days prior \nand complained of redness, pain, and decreased vision in both eyes \nfor 3 days. He had been treated with moxifloxacin, amikacin, and \nvancomycin eye drops for 3 days elsewhere without improvement. \nAt presentation, his visual acuity was 20/100 in the right eye and \n20/600 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed scattered \ngray-white nummular infiltrates in corneal stroma, worse in left eye, \nepithelial defects at the incision, and no hypopyon (Figure 1A and B). \nTreatment at our institution was continued using 5% vancomycin, \n0.5% moxifloxacin, 2% amikacin, and 0.3% tobramycin eye drops to \nboth eyes, alternating every 15 minutes. Since no significant change \nwas noted for two days, he underwent epi-on CXL on both eyes. On \nthe second day post-CXL, the corneal infiltrates were more localized \nand visual acuity improved to 20/50 in the right eye and 20/40 in the \nleft eye (Figure 1C and D). The medications were then reconciled to \ninclude 5% vancomycin and 0.5% moxifloxacin eye drops every hour, \ntacrolimus eye drop twice a day to suppress the immune response, \nand deproteinized calf blood extract ophthalmic gel 6 times a day \nto protect the corneal epithelium. However, corneal infiltrates and \nvision seized to improve in the next two days. While continuing the \nsame regimen, corneal lavage was initiated through a Morgan lens \n[9] at 10 ml/hour with 2.5% vancomycin for 1 hour, followed by 1.5% \ntobramycin for 1 hour, twice a day. After 3 days of lavage, the corneal \ninfiltrates became localized, and the epithelium healed (Figure 1E and \nF). Corneal scrapings were taken from both eyes at presentation, only \nGroup A Streptococcus grew from the left eye after 5 days of culturing. \nSince the infection had already improved, this microbiology result \ndid not influence our selection or use of antibiotics. On the 15th \nday of treatment (7th day after corneal lavage), although there were \nstill focal opacities in the corneal stroma, his vision in both eyes had \nrecovered to 20/20. Follow-up in 1 year showed no changes.\nCase 2\nTwo days after SMILE, an 18-year-old man complained of \nincreasing redness and tearing in both eyes for 1 day. Visual acuity \nwas 20/20 in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed scattered \ngray-white dot infiltrates under the central corneal flap without \nhypopyon in anterior chamber. As the corneal epithelium was intact \nand the infiltrates were deep, no corneal scraping was performed. The \npatient was treated with 0.3% tobramycin and 0.5% moxifloxacin \neye drops, alternating every 5 minutes, and 5% vancomycin eye \ndrop every 2 hours. In addition, same concentrations of vancomycin \nand tobramycin were also used for corneal lavage for 1 hour each, \nbut lavage was done only once due to patient\u2019s intolerance to the \nprocedure. CXL was then performed on both eyes on the second day. \nIn 2 days after CXL, the infiltrates in the left eye had become lighter \nand more confined, but vision in the right eye had decreased to 20/50, \nwith worsened corneal edema and infiltrates. 2.5% levofloxacin was \nthen used for lavage of the right eye for 1 hour, twice a day, for 2 \ndays, which essentially eradicated the infection. On the seventh day \nof admission, although there remained a few punctate hazes in the \nstroma, visual acuity in both eyes recovered to 20/20.\nCase 3\nA 22-year-old man developed infection in the right eye 1 day \nafter bilateral SMILE. He had been treated with 3% levofloxacin, \n5% vancomycin, 0.3% tobramycin eye drops, and 0.3% gatifloxacin \nophthalmic gel for 2 days with no significant improvement. Vision \nwas counting fingers at 10 cm in the right eye when seen at our \ninstitution. Slit-lamp examination revealed a 5 mm patch of gray-\nwhite infiltrate in the interface, two white dot infiltrates in the upper \nflap, as well as a 1 mm hypopyon (Figure 2A). Anterior segment OCT \nshowed melting and thinning of the corneal flap, with the thinnest \narea being 324 \u03bcm (Figure 2B). Confocal microscopy showed \nabundant inflammatory cells within the infiltrates. While increasing \nvancomycin, tobramycin drops and gatifloxacin ophthalmic gel to \nevery 5 minutes, vancomycin and tobramycin lavages were also done \nonce for 1 hour each. Given thin cornea, the patient was not offered \nCXL. Instead, interface irrigation with tobramycin and vancomycin \nwas performed. Interface sampling prior to irrigation identified \nStaphylococcus aureus on culture. One day following irrigation, the \ninfiltrate had become localized and hypopyon decreased. Topical \ntreatment was continued and adjusted accordingly with vancomycin, \ntobramycin eye drops, and gatifloxacin ophthalmic gel. On the \nseventh day of admission, the epithelium of the right eye had healed. \nAfter 2 weeks of treatment, only a patch of light opacity was visible \nin the superior paracentral stroma of the right eye. Four months \nlater, the corneal opacity faded in the right eye, and the visual acuity \nrecovered to 20/20 (Figure 2C).\nCase 4\nA 20-year-old man presented with redness and foreign body \nsensation, worse in the left eye, for about 1 day. Bilateral SMILE had \nbeen performed 2 days prior. He was treated locally with vancomycin, \ntobramycin, and levofloxacin eye drops for 1 day with no significant \nimprovement. Upon examination, his visual acuity was 20/40 in the \nright eye and 20/160 in the left eye. Diffuse punctate infiltrates and \nedema were observed in SMILE interface in both eyes. Within the \nsuperior flaps, two flaky dot infiltrates were visible in the right eye \nand three larger infiltrates in the left (Figure 3A and B). No scraping \nFigure 1:  Slit-lamp photographs of bacterial infection before and after \ncombined treatment following SMILE.\nInterface corneal infiltrates in both eyes in case 1 (1A, B); on the 2nd day \nafter CXL, the corneal infiltrates were more localized (1C, D), and after 3 days \nof corneal lavage, the infiltrates further diminished, the corneal epithelium \nhealed (1E, F)."

He was treated with 2% amikacin, 0.3% \ntobramycin, and 5% vancomycin eye drops, alternating every \n5 minutes for both eyes, combined with same vancomycin and \ntobramycin lavages for 1 hour each, twice on the first day. On the \nsecond day, after 1 hour of vancomycin and tobramycin lavages in the \nmorning, bilateral CXL was performed. No further lavage treatment \nwas continued after CXL. On the fourth day, the corneal infiltrates in \nboth eyes were localized, their density reduced, and corneal edema \nresolved (Figure 3C and D). On the tenth day, the corneal epithelium \nin both eyes was intact with small hazes remaining in the stroma, and \nvisual acuity returned to 20/25 in each eye (Figure 3E and F).\nDiscussion\nInfection that originates deep in the interface after SMILE can \nlead to rapid deterioration of vision if not treated promptly and \neffectively, as it can easily alter corneal transparency and refractive \nproperty [3,10,11]. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are \ncrucial. Unlike infectious corneal ulcers, culture from superficial \nscraping, even if positive, does not necessarily represent the causal \npathogen(s). Interface sampling through needle biopsy is too \ndestructive, whereas opening the SMILE pocket for sampling must \ndisrupt the healing incision site, potentially even causing corneal flap \nrupture [3] and increasing the risk of epithelial ingrowth. Moreover, \nculture and susceptibility can take days to yield any results. Therefore, \nit is important to develop a less invasive and effective empirical \nantimicrobial treatment protocol that can be applied timely and \nuniversally.\nCurrently, there is no consensus on the choice of antibiotic drugs \nfor bacterial keratitis after SMILE. Hence, treatment strategy for \nearly-onset bacterial keratitis after LASIK is often referenced. The \nAmerican Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery recommends \nadministering fourth-generation fluoroquinolones (0.5% gatifloxacin \nor 0.5% moxifloxacin) every 5 minutes, alternating with antibiotics \nsuch as 5% vancomycin that have enhanced activity against Gram-\npositive organisms every 30 minutes [12]. However, frequent \ntopical instillation of antibiotics cannot in all cases rapidly control \nthe infections as seen in this case series, possibly largely due to \nhinderance of penetration of antibiotics by the corneal flaps to deep-\nseeded infections within the interface.\nPrevious treatments reported in a few bacterial infection cases \nfollowing SMILE mainly involved frequent topical medications \ncombined with interface pocket irrigation [3-8]. However, corneal \nflap rupture occurred during irrigation in one report [3]. Although the \ninfection was controlled in this patient, a large opacity resulted in the \ncentral cornea ultimately affected the patient\u2019s best corrected vision. \nContinuous corneal lavage has been shown to be able to increase \ndrug concentrations in the cornea, about 10 folds more efficiently in \ncomparison to topical instillation, in time and drug concentration \n[13]. Clinically, this method has not only been proven effective for \nbacterial keratitis [9], but also for fungal keratitis in our previous \nstudies [14]. Hence, such treatment should be effective for bacterial \nkeratitis within the SMILE pockets, even without microbiology \nidentifications of causal pathogens from smears or cultures.\nIn this case series, all infected eyes received corneal lavage \ntreatment. The basic treatment protocol involved the use of 2.5% or \n5% vancomycin and 0.3% or 1.5% tobramycin for lavage, 1 hour each \ntwice a day, with the rest of the time supplemented by frequent topical \ninstillations. In case 2, 2.5% levofloxacin was continued instead and \nwas equally effective.  The choice of vancomycin and tobramycin \nwas based on previous experience in treatin g acute corneal ulcers \nFigure 2: Slit-lamp photographs and anterior segment OCT of case 3.\nCase 3. A. Before treatment, 2 deep white circular infiltrates in the upper flap were seen with the presence of 1 mm hypopyon; B. Anterior segment OCT shows \nmelting of the corneal flap in the right eye, with the thinnest cornea measuring 324um; enhanced corneal reflection was seen in the infection site beneath the \ncorneal flap; C. Follow-up visit in 4 months, the corneal opacity in the right eye had faded.\nFigure 3: Case 4, interface round flaky infiltrates in both eyes (3A,3B). On \nthe 4th day of combined treatment, the infiltrates became lighter, and the \ncorneal epithelium healed (3C, D). On the tenth day, there were only small \npatches of corneal stromal opacities remaining in both eyes (3E, F)."

All 4 pati ents promptly received frequent yet ineffective topical \nantibiotics for 1-2 days before seen at our institution. With our \ntreatment protocol, we believe continuous lavage played a crucial \nrole in rapidly controlling the interface bacterial infection after \nSMILE. Infections in all cases were timely controlled, and vision \npreserved to the greatest extent possible. In case 3, our most severe \ncase, the infection progressed rapidly with early corneal flap melting. \nSince CXL could not be performed due to thin cornea, only lavage \nand interface irrigation were done. Interface irrigation certainly \ncontributed to reducing pathogen numbers and mitigating further \ntissue damage from local inflammation; however, eradication of \ninfections was achieved without interface irrigation in all other cases \nin this series. \nPrior studies have also reported CXL as a therapy for bacterial \nkeratitis after SMILE. With CXL, Tommy et al. successfully treated a \npatient with bacterial keratitis after SMILE who had a poor response \nto frequent topical antibiotics and was unwilling to undergo interface \nirrigation [4]. Subsequently, Ganesh reported a case in which topical \nantibiotics combined with interface irrigation and CXL rapidly \ncontrolled the infection, improving visual acuity from 20/80 to 20/20 \n[8]. It is believed that an intact corneal flap after SMILE is beneficial \nfor maintaining the stability of corneal biomechanics [7]. CXL indeed \noffers an alternative adjunct therapy without the need of lifting \nthe flap. Ultraviolet-A and riboflavin not only have antimicrobial \nproperties but may also provide resistance to proteolytic enzymes \nand protect corneal integrity [15]. We performed CXL on 6 eyes with \ncorneal thickness greater than 400\u00b5m, and no adverse effects were \nseen in any cases. However, in cases 1 and 2, addition of CXL alone \nfailed to halt the progression of infections, suggesting limited role of \nCXL in aggressive infections. Whether the addition of CXL to lavage \nwould yield additional benefits requires further investigation.\nIn previous reports, the duration taken to control bacterial \ninfections following SMILE ranged from 10 days to 3 months [3-8]. \nOur combined treatment protocol in this series effectively controlled \nthe infections within 1 to 8 days, with the longest lavage treatment \nbeing 3 days, significantly shortened the treatment course, and \nrestored vision in all patients. \nPatients undergoing refractive surgeries have high expectations \nfor uncorrected postoperative vision. In the event of a postoperative \ninfection, timely and effective treatment is critical to minimize vision \nloss. The treatment strategy we adopted in this case series can be \nimplemented timely, even in rural settings, in the absence of pathogen \nidentification and antimicrobial susceptibility. Although the number \nof cases in this series is still small, it is evident that continuous \nantibiotic lavage had played a significant role. In the future, we \nplan to further refine the combined protocol of continuous corneal \nlavage with topical antibiotics and explore the additional benefits of \nCXL, in hope to minimize treatment time and costs while ensuring \ntherapeutic efficacy.\nDeclarations\nEthics approval and consent to participate\nThis study was performed in line with the principles of the \nDeclaration of Helsinki.

Initial evaluations suggested infectious and \nautoimmune etiologies, leading to treatment with multiple antibiotics, colchicine, and doxycycline. \nThe patient\u2019s condition was further complicated by pericardial effusion, persistent systemic \ninflammation, and delayed onset of arthritis during hospitalization. Extensive laboratory and \nimaging evaluations excluded malignancy and infectious causes. AOSD was ultimately diagnosed \nbased on clinical features and elevated inflammatory markers. The patient improved with high-dose \nglucocorticoids and was later transitioned to steroid-sparing therapy with canakinumab.\nDiscussion: This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of AOSD when cardinal features are \nabsent at presentation.

First described \nby Bywaters in 1971 as the adult counterpart of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, AOSD \npresents a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific symptoms and overlap with other conditions \nwhile typically manifesting after the age of 16 [1]. The etiology of AOSD remains unclear, but it is \nbelieved to result from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers, such as \ninfections [2,3]. The estimated incidence remains variable in the literature among different ethnic \ngroups.\nThe clinical presentation of AOSD is diverse, but three primary patterns characterize its course: \nmonophasic, intermittent, and chronic. All three patterns exist on a continuum and can evolve \ninto one another [3]. Typically, patients experience high spiking fevers exceeding 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F); \nhowever, these are not self-reported in all cases [4,5]. The fever pattern is typically quotidian or \ndouble quotidian, peaking in the late afternoon or evening, and returning to normal or subnormal \nlevels between spikes without use of antipyretics [6]. An evanescent, salmon-pink maculopapular \nrash often accompanies fever spikes, usually appearing on the trunk and proximal limbs and may be \nexacerbated by heat or mechanical irritation [6-8].\nJoint involvement is prominent, with patients experiencing arthralgia or arthritis affecting both \nlarge and small joints symmetrically. Chronic arthritis can lead to joint destructio n, particularly"

A severe sore throat is an early and frequent \nsymptom, characterized by intense pharyngeal discomfort without \nsignificant tonsillar exudate [5]. Generalized lymphadenopathy and \nenlargement of the liver and spleen are common, detectable through \nphysical examination or imaging studies [5]. Generalized muscle pain \ncan be severe and often correlates with fever spikes, contributing to \nsignificant patient discomfort [6].\nInflammation of serous membranes can lead to pleuritis \nand pericarditis, presenting as chest pain and dyspnea. These \nmanifestations require prompt recognition and management \n[9]. Laboratory abnormalities are significant in AOSD and may \ncommonly include leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, \nelevations in inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate \n[ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]), mild to moderate elevations \nin liver enzymes, and anemia, which is usually normocytic and \nnormochromic [7].\nLess commonly, patients may exhibit neurological symptoms \nlike aseptic meningitis or cardiac involvement, such as myocarditis. \nPulmonary manifestations, including interstitial lung disease, though \nrare, represent serious complications [8].\nDiagnosing AOSD is primarily based on clinical criteria after \nexcluding other potential causes. The most often used criterion, \nthe Yamaguchi Criteria, require five or more criteria (with at least \ntwo being major criteria) from a combination of major and minor \nclinical features [9]. The major criteria include fever of at least 39\u00b0C \nlasting one week or more, arthralgia or arthritis lasting two weeks \nor more, non-pruritic maculopapular rash during fever spikes, and \nleukocytosis of at least 10,000/mm\u00b3 with 80% or more neutrophils. \nThe minor criteria consist of sore throat, lymphadenopathy and/or \nsplenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, and negative antinuclear \nantibody (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) [10-12].\nCase Presentation\nPatient information/Presenting complaints/Medical \nhistory/Clinical findings\nPatient with a past medical history of attention deficit hyperactive \ndisorder with no known allergies presented to the emergency \ndepartment with complaints of malaise, peripheral edema, \nproductive cough, chest pain, and fevers for approximately 1 week. \nAdditionally, he reported bilateral upper and lower extremity edema \nwith generalized pain but denied joint pain. He reported an ongoing \nproductive cough for approximately 7 days with a sore throat that \nhad already resolved. He also reported diarrhea onset 1 week prior \nwith 3\u20134 watery bowel movements per day that had resolved upon \nadmission to the hospital.\nWhile the patient denied a history of joint pain, outside records \nshowed he had complained of headaches, clavicular pain, hand \npain, and knee pain during a previous emergency department visit \nfollowing a mechanical ground-level fall. Fevers were occurring \ndaily, but primarily at night. Upon further conversation, the patient \nreported a history of fevers for the last 2\u20133 months for which he could \nnot identify a clear pattern. Patient denied having a rash. Notably, \nthe patient was admitted for a brief time at an outside facility but \nleft on his own volition due to frustration with his medical care. \nFrom this hospitalization, the patient was noted to have leukocytosis, \nmarkedly elevated inflammatory markers with associated pleural and \npericardial effusions concerning for infectious versus autoimmune \netiology.\nThe patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime for 2 days, \nwhich were ultimately discontinued after no growth from his blood \ncultures for 48 hours. TTE revealed a small pericardial effusion. In \nthe setting of pleuritic chest pain, the patient was treated for potential \npericarditis with colchicine. He was also treated with doxycycline \ndue to concerns of a tick-borne illness. Mild elevation of AST and \nALT were noted. The patient ultimately elected to undergo a patient-\ndirected discharge with multiple labs pending. He was discharged \nwith a 14-day course of doxycycline and 3-month course of colchicine, \nbut shortly returned to the emergency department with persisting \nsymptoms.\nA comprehensive evaluation was conducted during his \nsubsequent hospitalization. CT chest with IV contrast revealed \nenlarged pulmonary veins and shadowing consistent with pericarditis \nwith no overt infectious findings. A peripheral blood smear was not \nconcerning for malignancy or other hematologic disorders. Notably, \nthe patient was found to have a positive Hepatitis-B antigen with a \nlow hepatitis-B antibody level. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) IgG was \nelevated with an elevation of EBV nuclear antigen as well. Prior to \nhis discharge from the previous hospitalization, SPEP with an IgM \nspike was noted with a normal kappa-lambda ratio. Transthoracic \nechocardiogram revealed a moderate posterior pericardial effusion \nmeasuring 1.5 cm.\nRheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, ANA, anti-Smith, RNP, double-\nstranded DNA, chromatin, SSA, SSB, anti-PR3, and anti-MPO were \nall within normal limits. During the admission, several subspecialties \nwere consulted, including infectious disease, hematology & oncology, \nrheumatology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and pulmonology. \nWhile admitted, the patient developed swelling and tenderness in \nhis distal interphalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, \nand metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally that was constant and \nrefractory to all opioids and acetaminophen. Topical diclofenac gel \nwas able to minimize the patient\u2019s pain.\nDuring the admission, the patient experienced worsening chest \npain and shortness of breath, which was attributed to a pericardial \neffusion with associated pericarditis.\nThis patient\u2019s initial exam findings were significant for elevated \ntemperature of 38.9\u00b0C, tachycardia with HR of 101, and hypertension \nwith a blood pressure of 142/69. He was also found to have 3+ \npitting edema in bilateral lower extremities, as well as trace edema \nin bilateral upper extremities. His cardiac and pulmonary evaluation \nwere unremarkable with the exception of diminished breath sounds \nover the bilateral lung bases. The patient eventually developed pain, \nedema, and decreased range of motion in multiple interphalangeal \njoints bilaterally on the second day of hospitalization.\nBased on the constellation of findings from the history/physical \nexamination and the presence of several laboratory abnormalities \n(leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, ferritin level, and inflammatory \nmarkers), the diagnosis of AOSD was felt to be the most likely etiology \nfor the patient\u2019s clinical presentation. Signs and symptoms included \npleuritic chest pain, arthralgia, joint swelling, fevers, and sore throat. \nAdditionally, the patient gradually improved with high-dose steroids, \nwhich suggested a probable autoinflammatory etiology. The patient \nunderwent extensive malignancy/infectious laboratory evaluations \nthat did not yield results consistent with a systemic process that could \nbetter explain his presentation.\nUltimately, the multidisciplinary team involved in this patient\u2019s"

Patients with mild disease can trial NSAIDs, although \nNSAIDs alone are not effective in approximately 75% of cases. Most \npatients require immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids \nfor acute flares. Chronic management usually involves the use of \nsteroid-sparing agents including methotrexate, anti-IL-1, or anti-IL-6 \nmedications. For refractory disease, anti-TNF agents or cyclosporin \nA can be used if other therapy is not effective [13].\nThe patient in this case was treated with high-dose IV steroids \nand subsequently transitioned to oral steroids at the time of discharge \nwith plans to gradually taper after initiation of a steroid-sparing agent.\nAt the patient\u2019s initial outpatient visit with Rheumatology, his \nsteroid dose was 40 mg of oral methylprednisolone daily. The patient \nreported significant improvement in signs and symptoms of joint \npain, chest pain, joint swelling, and fevers. In addition to subjective \nimprovement, laboratory results also improved. His leukocyte count, \nESR, and CRP were mildly elevated but had decreased compared to \ndischarge labs. His ferritin and liver enzymes returned to normal \nlevels. He did report side effects consistent with glucocorticoid use, \nincluding weight gain, acne, and facial swelling.\nCanakinumab was initiated at this visit at a dose of 300 mg every \n4 weeks. After starting Canakinumab, the patient was instructed to \nbegin tapering steroids with a dose reduction of 8 milligrams every 10 \ndays. He was advised to return in 1\u20132 months for follow-up.\nDiscussion\nIn the presented case, the patient exhibited several atypical \nfeatures when compared to the classic clinical presentation of adult-\nonset Still's disease (AOSD). Notably, the patient denied having the \ncharacteristic evanescent, salmon-pink rash that often accompanies \nfever spikes in AOSD. Additionally, while joint pain and arthritis \nare prominent early features in AOSD, affecting both large and \nsmall joints symmetrically, the patient initially denied joint pain. \nIt was only during the admission that he developed swelling and \ntenderness in the distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, \nand metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally. This delayed onset of \njoint symptoms differs from the typical presentation where arthritis \nis an early and persistent symptom.\nFurthermore, the patient presented with peripheral edema \nand a productive cough, symptoms not commonly associated with \nAOSD. While serositis manifesting as pleuritis and pericarditis is a \nrecognized feature of AOSD, the presence of significant peripheral \nedema and respiratory symptoms like productive cough may suggest \nalternative or additional diagnoses. The patient's positive Hepatitis \nB antigen and elevated Epstein\u2013Barr virus antibodies introduced \npotential infectious etiologies not characteristic of AOSD. Moreover, \nthe history of diarrhea and the detection of an immunoglobulin M \n(IgM) spike on serum protein electrophoresis are not typical findings \nin AOSD. These discrepancies highlight that the patient's presentation \ndiffers from the classic manifestations of AOSD, emphasizing the \nneed for a comprehensive evaluation to rule out other conditions.\nReferences\n1.

Although, \u03b1-tocopherol is the most bioavailable form of vitamin E. There are few reports \non bioavailability of tocotrienols in humans. Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of \u03b4-tocotrienol \nwas quantified on plasma levels of tocol isomers, cytokines, and microRNAs. Subjects were fed \ndoses of 125 mg/day to 500 mg/day. Plasma samples collected between 0 h to 10 h, levels of tocols \nestimated by HPLC, which resulted dose-dependent increases in AUC 0-10, Cmax0-\u221e, Tmaxh, t1/2h, Cl-T \n1/h, Vd/f, keh-1. Maximum plasma levels of \u03b4-tocotrienol were at 3 h (125 mg/day to 250 mg/day), 6 \nh (500 mg/d).

The \nhypercholesterolemic subjects were administered increasing doses \nof \u03b4-tocotrienol (125, 250, 500, 750 mg/d) plus AHA Step-1 diet for \n4-weeks during 30-weeks study period [9]. The \u03b4-tocotrienol plus \nAHA Step-1 diet caused significant reductions in lipid parameters in \ndose-dependent manner with maximum effects on total cholesterol \n(15%), LDL-cholesterol (18%), triglycerides (14%) with 250 mg/day \ndose and above 500 mg/d dose resulted induction in the levels of \nthese lipid parameters, without affecting HDL-cholesterol (Figures \n2A\u20132D) [9]. The cytokines associated with cardiovascular disease \n(plasma TNF-a, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) were down-regulated \n40% to 67% by \u03b4-tocotrienol treatment (Table 1A). Similar results \nwere obtained with gene expression of these cytokines using blood \nmessenger-RNA (Table 1B) [9]. Circulating miRNA-7a, miRNA-15a, \nmiRNA-20a (anti-angiogenic), miRNA-21, miRNA-29a, miRNA-\n92a (skeletal muscle regeneration), miRNA-200, miRNA-206 were \nup-regulated by \u03b4-tocotrienol treatment as compared to baseline in \nhypercholesterolemic subject values (Table 1C) [9]. These results \nconfirmed that consumption of d-tocotrienol plus AHA Step-1 diet \ncauses significant reduction in serum lipid parameters and several \ncytokines at a lower concentration with optimum dose of 250 mg/d \n[9]. The capacity of -tocotrienol to modulate inflammation is partly \nattributable to dose-dependent properties of inhibition/activation, \nwhich may play a major role in future treatment of cardiovascular \ndiseases [9].\nIt is well known that \u03b1-tocopherol is the most bioavailable \nform of vitamin E, but several animal and clinical studies have \nalso demonstrated tocotrienols bioavailability to various tissues. \nIt was also reported that the bio-discrimination of \u03b1-tocopherol \n(vitamin E) influences the rate of tocotrienol absorption, mainly \ndue to high affinity of \u03b1-tocopherol with \u201c\u03b1-Tocopherol Transfer \nProtein\u201d (\u03b1-TTP), which mediates secretion of \u03b1-tocopherol (100%) \nfrom the liver into the circulatory system and is much higher than \n\u03b1-tocotrienol (12%) or other tocotrienols [10,11]. There are few \nreports on bioavailability of tocotrienols in humans. Most studies \nwere carried out with mixtures of tocotrienols + tocopherols rather \nthan pure tocotrienols. Moreover, dietary \u03b1-tocopherol interferes \nwith the bioavailability of tocotrienols and prevents absorption and \ndelivery to organs and tissues [12,13]. Recently, Pharmacokinetics and \nbioavailability of Annatto-based d-tocotrienol on plasma levels of \u03b1-, \n\u03b2-, \u03b3-, \u03b4-tocotrienol and tocopherols were quantified and in addition, \nseveral cytokines and microRNAs were also reported [14].  An open-\nlabel, randomized study was reported the pharmacokinetics and \nbioavailability of \u03b4-tocotrienol in 33 healthy-fed subjects. In which, all \nsubjects (11/dose) were randomly assigned to doses of 125, 250, or 500 \nmg/d. Plasma samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 h intervals and \ntocols (tocotrienols and tocopherols) were estimated by HPLC [14]. \nThe results reported the effects of \u03b4-tocotrienol on pharmacokinetic \nparameters of all eight isomers of tocol. Supplementation of 125, \n250 and 500 mg/d doses of Annatto \u03b4-tocotrienol have resulted in \ndose-dependent increases of (a) area under concentration-time curve \n(AUCt\n0-t10, ng/ml) 2464, 5412, 14986; (b) maximum concentration \n \u03b4-Tocotrienol \u03b3-Tocotrienol\n# A: 125 mg 250 mg 500 mg B: 125 mg 250 mg 500 mg\n1 Area Under Curve-0 - 10 \n(AUC0-10; ng/mL) 2463.91 \u00b1 191.62a* 5412.50 \u00b1 274.04b 14985.73 \u00b1 362.63c  1258.18 \u00b1 126.26a* 5412.50 \u00b1 274.04b 6895.96 \u00b1 159.49c\n2 Area Under Curve-0 - \u221e \n(AUC\n0-\u221e; ng/mL) 2586.41 \u00b1 201.01a* 5514.75 \u00b1 287.01b 17111.94 \u00b1 444.71c  1647.95 \u00b1 270.72a* 5514.75 \u00b1 287.01b 7818.82 \u00b1 397.38c\n3 Plasma Peak Concentration \n(C\nmax; ng/mL) 828.82 \u00b1 24.28a 1920.36 \u00b1 57.99b 3278.00 \u00b1 124.13c  281.34 \u00b1 21.22a 833.73.36 \u00b1 28.22b 1224.64 \u00b1 61.28c\n4 Time to achieve plasma peak \n(T\nmax; h) 3.00 3.00 4.00  3.00 3.00 3.55 \u00b1 0.52\n5 Elimination of Half-life time\n(t1/2; h) 1.74 \u00b1 0.36\na 1.39 \u00b1 0.22a 2.54 \u00b1 0.05b  3.82 \u00b1 0.99a 1.39 \u00b1 0.28b 2.25 \u00b1 0.32c\n6 Time of clearance\n(Cl-T; I/h) 0.049 \u00b1 0.004\na 0.045 \u00b1 0.002a 0.030 \u00b1 0.001b  0.078 \u00b1 0.012a 0.045 \u00b1 0.002a 0.061 \u00b1 0.010b\n7\nApparent volume of \ndistribution \n(Vd/f)\n0.179 \u00b1 0.035\na 0.114 \u00b1 0.011b 0.613 \u00b1 0.102c  0.553 \u00b1 0.084a 0.461 \u00b1 0.114a 0.635 \u00b1 0.060b\n8 Elimination rate constant \n(ke; h-1) 0.381 \u00b1 0.059a 0.401 \u00b1 0.039b 0.050 \u00b1 0.008c  0.113 \u00b1 0.026a 0.133 \u00b1 0.037a 0.097 \u00b1 0.021b\nTable 2: Pharmacokinetic parameters after feeding single dose of various concentrations of \u03b4-tocotrienol (125 or 250 or 500 mg) in one day.\nTable 2a:\n  \u03b2-Tocotrienol \u03b1-Tocotrienol\n# C: 125 mg 250 mg 500 mg D: 125 mg 250 mg 500 mg\n1 Area Under Curve-0 - 10 \n(AUC0-10; ng/mL) 6933.73 \u00b1 129.58a* 7080.36 \u00b1 206.62a 7680.41 \u00b1 272.59b  869.96 \u00b1 43.95a* 1369.91 \u00b1 26.30b 1900.68 \u00b1 46.29c\n2 Area Under Curve-0 - \u221e \n(AUC\n0-\u221e; ng/mL) 8839.28 \u00b1 656.29a* 9184.14 \u00b1 674.76a 10391.37 \u00b1 621.69b  1041.77 \u00b1 108.82a* 1558.09 \u00b1 77.13b 22290.14 \u00b1 65.53c\n3 Plasma Peak Concentration \n(C\nmax; ng/mL) 979.00 \u00b1 79.45a 1083.73 \u00b1 82.26b 1279.00 \u00b1 116.44c  139.91 \u00b1 11.03a 204.91 \u00b1 9.47b 290.09 \u00b1 9.84c\n4 Time to achieve plasma peak \n(T\nmax; h) 4.00 3.64. \u00b1 0.41 3.00  2.73 \u00b1 0.65 3.00 3.00\n5 Elimination of Half-life time \n(t1/2; h) 3.92 \u00b1 0.86a 3.90 \u00b1 0.79a 4.39 \u00b1 0.63a  2.62 \u00b1 0.81a 2.89 \u00b1 0.84a 3.71 \u00b1 0.29b\n6 Time of clearance \n(Cl-T; I/h) 0.094 \u00b1 0.007a 0.090 \u00b1 0.007a 0.080 \u00b1 0.005b  0.303 \u00b1 0.135a 0.161 \u00b1 0.008b 0.109 \u00b1 0.003c\n7 Apparent volume of distribution \n(Vd/f) 0.174 \u00b1 0.011\na 0.223 \u00b1 0.013b 0.415 \u00b1 0.019c  0.590 \u00b1 0.061a 0.922 \u00b1 0.067b 1.365 \u00b1 0.045c\n8 Elimination rate constant \n(ke; h-1) 0.542 \u00b1 0.062\na 0.404 \u00b1 0.032b 0.192 \u00b1 0.014c  1.234 \u00b1 0.211a 0.201 \u00b1 0.050b 0.214 \u00b1 0.009b\nTable 2b:"

Maximum plasma levels of d-tocotrienol were \nobserved at 3 h with doses of 125 and 250 mg/d, and 6 h with 500 \nmg/d. \u03b3-Tocotrienol, \u03b2-tocotrienol, \u03b1-tocotrienol, and \u03b4-tocopherol, \n\u03b3-tocopheol, \u03b2-tocopherol, \u03b1-tocopherol were appeared in the plasma \nafter 2 h (Tables 2A-2D) [14]. Moreover, \u03b4-tocotrienol treatment \nresulted in down-regulation of eight cytokines and up-regulation \nof adiponectin, TGF-b1, and leptin (Table 2). The gene expression \nof miR-34a (increased in bipolar disorder) was down-regulated, \nbut expression of miR-107, miR-122a, and miR-132 (decreased in \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease) was up-regulated by \u03b4-tocotrienol treatment \n(Table 3) [14]. These were the first results, which have described the \neffect of \u03b4-tocotrienol on pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of \nall eight isomers of tocol. When tocotrienols are supplemented in \nabsence of tocopherols, \u03b4-tocotrienol has better bioavailability and \n\u03b4-tocotrienol is converted stepwise to other tocotrienols/tocopherols \nas shown in Figure 4 [14]. These results have supported that \ntocotrienol, particularly \u03b4-tocotrienol, as a dietary supplement might \nbe useful in the prevention of age-related and chronic ailments [14].\n Tocotrienols lowered serum lipid parameters below 500 mg/d while \nincreased lipid parameters at higher dose of 750 mg/d compared to \n250 mg/d [9]. These results were further supported by our earlier \nfindings of inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity of 20S rabbit \nmuscle proteasome with 40 mM of \u03b4-tocotrienols and activation with \n80 mM [15]. Thus d-tocotrienol has a novel property of concentration-\ndependent inhibition and activation.

These higher \ndoses of tocotrienols were found to be safe and might be useful for \nthe treatments of various types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease [16]. Inflammation has been implicated in cancer, diabetes \nand cardiovascular disease [17-19]. The important role played by \nLipopolysaccharides (LPS) in up-regulating inflammation is well-\nestablished [20]. LPS is expressed on the outer membrane of gram-\nnegative bacteria, and induces several pro-inflammatory cytokines, \nsuch as Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), \nIL-6, IL-8 and production of nitric oxide [20]. The 32 compounds of \ndifferent categories of organic chemistry as shown in Table 6 were \nselected to find out potent inflammatory biomarkers. The Peroxisome \nProliferator-Activated Receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) knockout female mice \nwere selected for the study due to their different effects in LPS-induced \nmacrophages of \u03b4-tocotrienol, riboflavin, quercetin on secretion of \nTNF-\u03b1 (activation) compared to corresponding wild type (C57BL/6) \ncontrol (inhibition) group [21], and also due to the prolonged \nresponse to inflammatory stimuli [22]. Moreover, the PPARs mice \ncontain nuclear receptors, which bind to fatty acid-derived ligands \nand activate the transcription of genes that govern lipid metabolism. \nThe primary sites of activation of PPAR-\u03b1, which recognizes \nmonounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids, \nare present in liver, heart, muscle, and kidney [23]. According to \nits role in regulating fatty acid metabolism, PPAR-\u03b1 activates gene \nexpression involved in fatty acid uptake (fatty acid binding protein), \n\u03b2-oxidation (medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, carnitine \npalmitoyl transferase I, and acyl-CoA oxidase), transport into"

The possible mechanism \nfor inhibition might be due to decreased proteolytic degradation of \nP-I\u03baB protein, followed by decreased translocation of activated NF-\n\u03baB, and depressed transcription of gene expression of TNF-\u03b1, and \niNOS activity (Figures 7A-7C) [23]. These results have provided \ntwo sets of compounds, anti-inflammatory (control of diabetes and \ncardiovascular disease), and pro-inflammatory for the treatment of \ncancer and other diseases [23]. \nCancer is second most common cause of death in the United \nState. There are over 100 different types of cancer associated with \ndifferent human organs, predominantly breast, liver, pancreas, \nprostate, colon, rectum, lung, and stomach. The properties of pro-\ninflammatory (for treatment of various types of cancers), and anti-\ninflammatory (for cardiovascular disease and diabetes) compounds \nhave been reported [17,18]. The major problem associated with \ndevelopment of anticancer drugs is their lack of solubility in aqueous \nsolutions and severe side effects in cancer patients. Therefore, \nthe anticancer properties, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic"

Prostate cancer cells\n \nFigures 8(1\u20134): Dose-dependent response for anti-proliferative properties of various compounds in cancer cells of Hela, liver, pancreas, and prostate. \nThe cancer cell lines of Hela, liver, pancreas, and prostate were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 10 mg/mL, gentamicin at \n37oC in a humidified atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2) and 95% oxygen (O2) as described previously [24]. Cancer cells (1 x 105) of various organs were \nseeded in 48 well tissue culture plate with 900 ml of medium containing 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide of different types of cancer cell lines (Hela cell, liver, pancreas, \nand prostate), and incubated at 37 \u00baC for 2 h. After 2 h, different concentrations (100 ml of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mM) of thiostrepton, ampicillin, dexamethasone, \n2-methoxyestradiol, d-tocotrienol, (-) riboflavin, ascorbic acid, quercetin, amiloride, and quinine sulphate in triplicate were added to each well, incubated for 48 h at \n37 \u00baC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2. The anticancer properties and dose-dependence for eleven compounds are presented for Hela, liver, pancreas, and \nprostate cancer cell lines. Values in a column not sharing a common symbol are significantly different at \u00b6 = P < 0.001; \u00a7 = P < 0.01; \u2021 = P < 0.05; \u2020 = control [24].\nactivity of novel naturally occurring, or FDA approved, nontoxic, \nproteasome inhibitors/activators, mostly aqueous soluble (Figure \n5) were reported in cancer cell lines obtained from various organs \n[24]. The results of treatments of several compounds in cancer \ncell lines were found to be very effective in inducing apoptosis of \ncancer cells. Thiostrepton, dexamethasone, 2-methoxyestradiol, \n\u03b4-tocotrienol, quercetin, amiloride, and quinine sulfate have \nsignificant anti-proliferation properties in Hela cells (44% to 87%) \nwith doses of 2.5 mM to 20 mM, compared to respective controls  \n(Table 7 and Figures 8(1-4) [24]. However, thiostrepton, \ndexamethasone, 2-methoxyestradiol, d-tocotrienol, quercetin, \nand quinine sulphate were effective in pancreatic, prostate, breast, \nlungs, melanoma, B-lymphocytes, and T-cells (Jurkat: 40% to 95%) \ncompared to respective controls (Table 7). In lung cancer cells, these \ncompounds were effective between 5 mM to 40 mM (Table 7) [24]. \nThe results of thiostrepton, 2-methoxyestradiol, \u03b4-tocotrienol, and \nquercetin were very effective and induced apoptosis in the range of \n(70% to 92%) in Hela and liver cells. All these results were translated \ninto possible IC\n50 values of anticancer activities and IC 50 values of \nanti-proliferation properties of thiostrepton in most of these cell lines \nwere between doses of 2.5 mM to 5 mM, dexamethasone 2.5 mM to \n20 mM, lactone 40 mM to 80 mM (Table 8) [24]. These  results have \ndemonstrated effectiveness of several natural-occurring compounds \nwith anti-proliferative properties against cancer cells of several organs \nof humans. Thiostrepton, dexamethasone, 2-methoxyestradiol, \nd-tocotrienol and quercetin are very effective for apoptosis of \ncancer cells in liver, pancreas, prostate, breast, lung, melanoma, \nB-lymphocytes, and T-cells. The results have provided an opportunity \nto test these compounds either individually or in combination as dietary \nsupplements in humans for treatment of various types of cancers [24]. \nAs mentioned earlier that \u03b4-Tocotrienol is a naturally occurring \nproteasome inhibitor, which has the capacity to inhibit \nproliferation and induce apoptosis in several cancer cells obtained \nfrom several organs of humans, and other cancer cell lines [24].  \nMoreover, results of plasma total mRNAs after \u03b4-tocotrienol feeding \nto hepatitis C patients revealed significant inhibition in the expression \nof pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, VCAM1, proteasome \nsubunits) and induction in the expression of ICAM1 and IFN-\u03b3 after \npost-treatment [25]. This down-regulation of proteasome subunits \nleads to autophagy, apoptosis of immune cells and several genes. \nThe results reported RNA-sequence analysis of plasma total mRNAs \nobtained from \u03b4-tocotrienol treatment of hepatitis C patients of pre-\ndose vs. post-dose on gene expression regulated by proteasome [25]. \nThe data based on >1 and 8-fold expression changes of 2136 genes \nwere fed into \u201cIngenuity Pathway Analyses (IPA)\u201d for core analysis, \nwhich describes possible canonical pathways, upstream regulators \ndiseases and functional metabolic networks [25].\nThe IPA of \u201cmolecules\u201d indicated fold change in gene expression \nof 953 molecules, which covered several categories of biological \nbiomarkers. Out of these, gene expression of 220 related to this study, \n12 were up-regulated, and 208 down-regulated after d-tocotrienol \ntreatment (Table 9A, 9B). The gene expression of transcription"

The mammalian Target of \nRapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a critical regulator of autophagy \ninduction, with activated mTOR (AKT and MAPK signaling) \nsuppressing autophagy, and negative regulation of mTOR (AMPK and \np53 signaling) promoting it [28]. The autophagy pathway (Figure 9A) \nhighlights the key molecular events involved in triggering autophagy. \nInhibiting the proteasome activity also causes the onset of autophagy, \nas observed with tocotrienol treatment. Apoptosis is a coordinated \nenergy-dependent process that involves the activation of a group of \ncysteine proteases called caspases and a cascade of events that link \nthe initiating stimuli to programmed cell death [29]. The two main \npathways of apoptosis are the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Each \npathway requires specific triggers to initiate a cascade of molecular \nevents that converge at the stage of caspase-3 activation (Figure 9B) \n[30]. The activation of caspase-3 in turn triggers an execution pathway \nresulting in characteristic cytomorphological features including cell \nshrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and DNA \nfragmentation [30]. Further details of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways \nwere found in the attached Ingenuity Apoptosis Signaling Pathway \n(Figure 9B), which highlights the key molecular events involved in \ntrigging apoptosis. These are followed by protein ubiquitination, Toll-\nLike Receptor signaling (TLRs), Signal Transducers and Activators of \nTranscription (STATs), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) transcription \nfactors pathways play major roles in a variety of cellular processes, such \nas cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, transcriptional \nregulation, cell surface receptors, ion channels regulation have been \ndiscussed in several publications [31,32]. These results are consistent \nwith these conclusions and \u03b4-tocotrienol treatment of hepatitis C \npatients, acts by increasing cell death, and necrosis of malignant \ntumors, and by decreasing viral infection, cellular growth, and \nproliferation, decreasing endocrine system disorders such as diabetes \nmellitus, and mobilization of calcium. Therefore, tocotrienols can \nsafely be used for hepatitis C patients, without any side effects. This \nis first report describing RNA-sequence analysis of d-tocotrienol \ntreated plasma total mRNAs obtained from chronic hepatitis C \npatients that acts via multiple-signaling pathways without any \nside-effect. These studies may lead to development of novel classes"

Impaired serum/plasma fasting glucose, \nHbA1c, hs-CRP are biomarkers, normally used to determine onset \nof diabetes. \u03b4-Tocotrienol, vitamin D 3, and resveratrol (nutritional \nsupplement-NS-3) are potent anti-cholesterolemic, anti-oxidative \nand anti-inflammatory agents. It was hypothesized that a mixture of \n\u03b4-tocotrienol, vitamin D\n3, resveratrol (NS-3; Figure 5) will be more \neffective treatment for reducing diabetes biomarkers as compared to \nits individual components in people with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n(T2DM) [33]. Therefore, estimations of NS-3 mixture and its \nindividual components were carried out to test the hypothesis, on \ndiabetes and inflammatory biomarkers, using Peripheral Blood \nMononuclear Cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy, normal and \npeople with T2DM. A randomized placebo controlled double-blinded \nprospective trial of individual components ( n=30/component), \nand NS-3 trial of people with T2DM (n=56/group), were given two \ncapsules/d of cellulose/olive oil as placebo, individual components, \nor NS-3 mixture for 24-weeks [34]. There was significant down-\nregulation (15-74) of gene expression with individual components \nand NS-3 mixture on diabetes biomarkers (IRS-1, SOD-2, GCKR, \nICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-6, IL-8) in PBMCs of T2DM (Figure 10), \nand in serum values of fasting glucose (11%), HbA1c (10%), hs-CRP \n(23%), fasting insulin (9%), HOMA-IR (20%), MDA (20%) of NS-3 \ntreated people with T2DM after 24-weeks (Table 11) [34].

The results \nreported the effectiveness of NS-3 on gene expression of mRNAs, \nmiRNAs, and paired mRNA-miRNA in people with T2DM [35]  \n, and this was an extension of a randomized placebo controlled double-\nblinded clinical trial of T2DM ( n=56/group) given two capsules/d of \ncellulose/olive oil (placebo), or NS-3 for 24 weeks [34]. Pure mRNAs \nand miRNAs of plasma of pre-dose versus post-dose of NS-3 treated \nsamples were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), and \nwas analyzed by \u201cIngenuity Pathways Analyses (IPA)\u201d [35].

It is clear from this Figure  12 that a single miRNA can \nregulate multiple targets of mRNAs, for example miRNA-5481 \ntargets several mRNAs associated with T2DM (Figure 12) [35]. \nThe interaction network of miR-29b-3p is generated using genes/\nmolecules/pathways based on experimentally observed evidence \nof directly interacting with miR-29b-3p in people with T2DM. The \nmolecules are organized according to their subcellular locations such \nas extracellular space, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, or \n\u201cother\u201d category (Figure 13) [35]. The transcriptome expression data \nof network indicates red shades denote intensities of up-regulation, \nwhereas green shades denote intensities of down-regulation of genes, \nand gray denote no change in post-treatment group compared with \npre-treatment group. For example, LOXL2 enzyme coding gene has \nlog2FC of -2.38 and has a darker green shade as compared to LAMC1 \nwhich has log2FC of only -0.19 and hence has lighter shade of green. \nWhereas the location of TUG1 is specified in \u201cother\u201d category (Figure \n13). There were eighteen (18) red up-regulated genes (FAM3C, \nAGO2, PPM1D, FAM3C, SPARC, ANKHD1/ANKD1/EIF4, EBP3, \nTP53, MLF1, PURA, CNOT8, DNMT3A, PP1C, 2FP36L, HMGN3, \nMYBL2, TUBB2A, ZFP36L), four (4) green down-regulated genes \n(LOXL2, COL1A2, LAMC1, GPR37) and seven (7) gray no change \ngenes (COL5A2, SHFOOM2, TRIM9, DCP2, RERE, NAV5, HDAC4) \n[35]. In summary, all results of experimental design with respect to \nmRNA, miRNA, and paired mRNA-miRNA of IPA analyses data of \ngene expression profile of post-treatment has been described by Venn \ndiagrams, incorporating network images and canonical pathways. \nThe network images indicate 9 mRNA, 10 miRNA and overlap of 29 \npaired mRNA-miRNA (Figures 14A, 14B), indicating their functions \nin Tables 16A-16C [35]. The most specific network images relevant \nto present study are from mRNA category (RNA-trafficking, cell-\nmediated-immune-response, infdisease, lipid metabolism) and \nfrom miRNA (immunological disease, immune-cell-trafficking, and \nhematological-disease) as reported in Tables 16A-16C. Similarly, \nVenn diagram of canonical pathways indicating 74 mRNAs, 23 \nmiRNAs, and 174 paired mRNA-miRNA (Figure 14A, 14B ), and \nlist of all the pathways are listed in Tables 16A-16C [35]. The list of \nthese pathways of mRNAs, miRNAs and paired mRNA-miRNA have \nconfirmed earlier above reported results. In short, Venn diagrams \nhave established genetic regulatory network images and canonical \nsignaling pathways for mRNA, miRNA, and paired mRNA-miRNA \nof gene expression profiles of pre-dose vs. post-dose of NS-3 treatment \ngroup [35]. The NS-3 treatment of people with T2DM indicates up- or \ndown-regulation of several new miRNAs (miR-29b-3p, miR-624-5p, \nmiR-361-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-3912-3p, miR-374c-5p, miR-4326 \n[HbA1c], miR-1247-3p, miR-874-5p) which may be used to identify \nonset of T2DM. Overexpression of mRNA-AL1621513 indicates \noxidative stress in people with T2DM, resulting in complications of \ndiabetes (neuropathy, retinopathy, and stroke) [35].\nConclusions\nThese results confirm that consumption of \u03b4-tocotrienol \nplus AHA Step-1 diet causes significant reduction in serum lipid \nparameters and several cytokines (TNF-a, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-"

The capacity of \n\u03b4-tocotrienol to modulate inflammation is partly attributable to \ndose-dependent properties of inhibition/activation, which may play \na major role in future treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The effect \nof \u03b4-tocotrienol on pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of all eight \nisomers of tocol indicated that when tocotrienols are supplemented \nin absence of tocopherols, \u03b4-tocotrienol has better bioavailability, and \n\u03b4-tocotrienol is converted stepwise to other tocotrienols/tocopherols. \nThese results also support that tocotrienol, particularly \u03b4-tocotrienol, \nas a dietary supplement might be useful in the prevention of age-\nrelated and chronic ailments. The pharmacokinetics of higher doses \nof 750 mg and 1000 mg of \u03b4-tocotrienol have confirmed that T\nmax was \n3 h to 4 h for all tocol isomers except \u03b1-tocopherol (6 h), and these \nhigher doses of tocotrienols are found to be safe and might be useful \nfor the treatments of various types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease. The present results have provided two sets of compounds, \nanti-inflammatory (for the control of diabetes and cardiovascular \ndisease), and pro-inflammatory for the treatment of cancer and \nother diseases. These results also demonstrate effectiveness of several \nnatural-occurring compounds with anti-proliferative properties \nagainst cancer cells of several organs of humans. Thiostrepton, \ndexamethasone, 2-methoxyestradiol, \u03b4-tocotrienol and quercetin are \nvery effective for apoptosis of cancer cells in liver, pancreas, prostate, \nbreast, lung, melanoma, B-lymphocytes, and T-cells. The results have \nprovided an opportunity to test these compounds either individually \nor in combination as dietary supplements in humans for treatment \nof various types of cancers. The results of fold-change expression \ndata analyzed by \u201cIngenuity Pathway Analysis\u201d describe the effect of \n\u03b4-tocotrienol in chronic hepatitis C patients on biological mechanisms \nat molecular level. It also revealed an insight of correlation of signaling \npathways and transcriptional factors. The collective results indicated \nthat tocotrienols inhibit cancer cell proliferation, promotes cell \ncycle arrest, decreases angiogenesis and acts via multiple signaling \npathways. These results clearly indicates that \u03b4-tocotrienol treatment \nof hepatitis C patients, acts by increasing cell death, and necrosis \nof malignant tumors, and by decreasing viral infection, cellular \ngrowth, and proliferation, decreasing endocrine system disorders \nsuch as diabetes mellitus, and mobilization of calcium. Therefore, \ntocotrienols can safely be used for hepatitis C patients, without any \nside effects. These results of in vitro and in vivo studies support our \nhypothesis that NS-3 mixture is more effective in lowering serum \nlevels of several diabetes and inflammatory biomarkers including \ngene expression markers compared to its individual components in \npeople with T2DM. Moreover, the NS-3 treatment of people with \nT2DM indicates up- or down-regulation of several new miRNAs \n(miR-29b-3p, miR-624-5p, miR-361-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-3912-3p, \nmiR-374c-5p, miR-4326 [HbA1c], miR-1247-3p, miR-874-5p) which \nmay be used to identify onset of T2DM. Overexpression of mRNA-\nAL1621513 indicates oxidative stress in people with T2DM, resulting \nin complications of diabetes (neuropathy, retinopathy, and stroke).\nAcknowledgement\nI thank my wife (of more than fifty years, Dr. Nilofer Qureshi) of \ntremendous support, encouragement, helpful discussion, motivation \nand editing the several manuscripts throughout my research, also \nthank to Arif A.

Episodes of Acute Heart Failure \n(AHF) account for 1.76 million hospitalizations per year, which are associated with high rates of \nreadmission and postdischarge mortality. Th\ne early postdischarge period following AHF-initiated \nhospitalization is a particularly vulnerable time. Also, identifying which patients are at highest risk \nof postdischarge mortality or readmission, and which patients may benefit from closer follow-up, \nis complex-as evidenced by the multitude of clinical risk scores developed for this purpose. Most \nmortality-risk models include advanced age, low blood pressure, low sodium concentration, and \nimpaired renal function. However, clinicians should be aware that risk-stratification tools may not \naccount for other established or emerging prognostic factors, which include the presence of organ \ndamage, length of hospital stay, socioeconomic status, social and/or family support, and social \nstability. Each episode of acute decompensation leads to further deterioration of cardiac and kidney \nfunction and progression of HF, with hospitalization for AHF itself a strong predictor of subsequent \ndeath in patients with chronic HF. Th\nis underscores the importance of efforts to avoid acute episodes \nthrough optimization of chronic HF management. Appropriate patient education, timely follow-\nup, and effective treatment of comorbidities are important for postdischarge HF management. \nMoreover, Guideline-Directed Evaluation and Management (GDEM) of patients with HF should \nbe optimized by awareness of updates and appropriate implementation of newly added therapies.\nKeywords: Heart failure; Hospitalization; Comorbidity; Blood pressure; Dyspnea\nIntroduction\nHeart Failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional \ncardiac abnormalities and the body\u2019s compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output [1,2]. \nAlthough typically characterized by shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling, HF can vary in \nsigns and symptoms [3]. Stable chronic HF is punctuated by acute episodes of decompensation in \nwhich signs and symptoms of HF gradually or rapidly worsen, eventually requiring urgent medical \nattention and typically hospitalization [1]. Patients hospitalized with Acute Heart Failure (AHF) \nmay be experiencing a worsening of previously stable chronic HF, namely Acute Decompensated \nHeart Failure (ADHF), or present with new-onset ( de novo) AHF [3,4]. In the Atherosclerosis \nRisk in Communities (ARIC; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00005131) study, 53% of incident \nADHF hospitalizations consisted of patients with a previous HF diagnosis [5]. Inpatient morbidity \nand mortality rates for AHF vary based on the clinical presentation, patient characteristics, and \nsocioeconomic status, with higher mortality for acute decompensated chronic HF than for de novo \nAHF [6].\nWith an estimated incidence of 915,000 cases per year, AHF leads to approximately 1.8 million \nhospitalizations in the United States annually [7,8]. Risk-standardized readmission rates for HF are \nhigher than those for myocardial infarction or stroke [9], with more than 20% of patients readmitted \nwithin the first 30 days after discharge [10]. Based on large-scale registry data, the rate of in-hospital \nmortality in the United States ranges from 2.6% to 4.0%, and the risk for mortality remains high \nover the subsequent year (Table 1). The immediate months postdischarge represent a particularly \nvulnerable period, with increased risks for readmission or death [11-13]. Each episode of acute \ndecompensation leads to further deterioration of cardiac and kidney function, thereby contributing \nto progression of HF and decreasing chances of survival following another episode [12,14,15]. \nFurthermore, hospitalization for ADHF is a strong predictor of subsequent death in patients with \nDavid Smith1*, James Ampadu2, Maen D Abou Ziki1 Syed Mehdi3 and Forrester A Lee1\n1Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, USA\n2Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Mercy Hospital St. Louis, USA\nOPEN ACCESS\n*Correspondence:\nDavid Smith, Department of Internal \nMedicine, Department of Post Graduate \nMedical Education, Yale University \nSchool of Medicine, 1600 Churchill \nDowns Drive, Waxhaw, NC 28173, \nUSA, Tel: +1-704- 609-7334;\nE-mail: david.n.smith@yale.edu \nReceived Date: 01 Nov 2021 \nAccepted Date: 08 Dec 2021 \nPublished Date: 27 Dec 2021\nCitation: \nSmith D, Ampadu J, Abou Ziki MD, \nMehdi S, Lee FA.

Insights may be gained from these large-\nscale AHF registries regarding the characteristics commonly present \nin patients hospitalized for AHF. At equal rates among men and \nwomen, patients admitted for an AHF episode are typically older \nand present with cardiovascular comorbidities. Most patients have \nhypertension, nearly one-half have coronary artery disease, and about \none-third has atrial fibrillation (Table 2).\nNoncardiovascular comorbidities, particularly diabetes mellitus, \nrenal dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are \nalso common in patients hospitalized for AHF (Table 2). These \nconditions may impact the pathophysiological progression of HF \nand complicate HF treatment [17]. Hypertension is the leading cause \nof HF with preserved ejection fraction (ejection fraction \u2265 50%) [3]. \nHowever, randomized clinical trials of HF have focused mainly on \npatients with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction \u2264 40%), and \nthe clinical benefit of HF therapy has been demonstrated only in these \npatients [3].\nUnderstanding the precipitating causes of ADHF helps guide \nappropriate treatment and prevents acute events in patients with \nchronic HF [18]. Various precipitating factors (including ischemia, \nuncontrolled hypertension, and arrhythmia) for hospital admission \nthat have been identified from AHF registries are shown in Table 2  \n[3]. In the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in \nHospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry, \na significantly higher risk for 60 to 90 day postdischarge mortality \nwas observed in patients whose hospitalizations for AHF were \nprecipitated by ischemia/acute coronary syndrome (adjusted Odds \nRatio (OR), 1.52; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.20-1.93; P<0.001) \nor worsening renal function (adjusted OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.06-2.00; \nP=0.02) [18]. Other registries have shown that, among non-ischemic \nprecipitants, renal dysfunction and infection adversely affect patients\u2019 \nlong-term survival [19].\nRace is also a factor, with many HF admissions in black patients \neither being under recognized, undertreated, or outpatient medical \nmanagement being undervalued. Over the next decade, it is projected \nthat the proportion of black individuals with HF will grow at a faster \nrate than any other ethnic group and HF tends to occur approximately \n10 years earlier in black patients compared with white patients [20-\n22]. Black patients also have higher rates of chronic HF exacerbations, \nlonger hospital stays, and a greater mortality rate compared with their \nwhite counterparts [5,23,24]. Unfortunately, major studies in HF \nwere unable to enroll significant proportions of black patients and less \nthan 25% of black patients received hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, \nwhich is guideline-recommended for African Americans and shown \nto substantially reduce all-cause mortality and hospitalizations [25-\n27]. These findings raise questions about the utility of therapies being \nindicated for particular ethnic groups to treat HF exacerbations. \nManagement of HF in black patients could be improved by increased \nrecognition and aggressive treatment of hypertension, which is more \nprevalent in black communities [28] and is a strong risk factor for HF \nin black patients [29].\nWho is at increased risk of poor outcomes following hospital \nadmission for AHF?: Established independent predictors of \nmorbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized for HF have \nbeen reviewed elsewhere and, as noted in Table 3, include age, \ncomorbidities, selected laboratory values, and race [12,17]. Predictors \nof 30 day readmission among patients with HF have been examined \nin several studies: increased concentrations of B-type Natriuretic \nPeptide (BNP) and troponin, and a higher number of prior \nhospitalizations, have been associated with increased risk of hospital \nreadmission; whereas the presence of comorbidities, such as diabetes \nmellitus and hypertension, have not been consistently linked with the \nrisk of hospital readmission [30,31].\nAdditional factors, with some seemingly minor, may affect \nthe outcomes of an AHF episode in clinical practice. For example, \ntreatment-seeking behaviors have been observed as different between \nmen and women, which may impact patient outcomes. Men typically \ndefer seeking medical treatment, as evidenced by longer prehospital \ndelays between the time of acute symptom onset and arrival at the \nemergency department [32] and delays between the onset of worsening \nsymptoms and the time at which the patient contacts a healthcare \nprovider [33]. Older age [34], the presence of depressive symptoms \n[35], and non-ambulance transport to the hospital [32] have also been \nshown to be independent predictors of longer prehospital delays. \nSuch contributing factors have important implications regarding \noutcomes in patients with AHF.

Similarly, frailty has been linked with readmissions among \npatients who have received mechanical support devices, such as left  \nventricular assist devices [42].\nAnother factor associated with increased risk for readmission \nafter hospitalization for AHF is the distance between the patient\u2019s \nresidence and the hospital. The increased risk of hospital readmission \nis proportional to the distance from hospital to home [43]. Increasing \ngeographic remoteness has been shown to increase the risk of \nreadmission in some, but not all, studies of postdischarge patient \npopulations and in patients hospitalized for cardiac procedures [44-\n47]. Thus, surveys among patients hospitalized for HF have observed \nthat the most desired intervention was to locate appointments \nconvenient to patients\u2019 homes [48]. In urban communities with \ncongested traffic grids, patients may have time limitations to their \naccess to care [48,49].\nRisk stratification\nRisk stratification for patients with AHF has received increasing \nattention as hospitals seek to determine which patients may best \nbe treated in the emergency department before being sent home, \nwhich require further observation, and which need to be admitted \nfor hospital care [50-52]. Risk stratification for AHF may also help \nidentify patients at greatest risk of hospital readmission or death who \nwill benefit from receiving more intensive follow-up after discharge. \nThis section will discuss the practical risk stratification of patients \nbased on their risk for poor AHF outcomes to determine appropriate \nmedical therapy and follow-up care strategies [3].\nInitial evaluation\nThe initial patient evaluation is used to identify any precipitating \nfactors and underlying conditions that may contribute to the patients\u2019 \nrisk for poor outcomes using readily evaluable demographic and \nclinical characteristics. As discussed above, age, sex, race, systolic \nBP, and certain comorbidities have been found to be independent \npredictors of morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized for \nHF [17] and should, therefore, be included in the initial patient \nevaluation. In addition, polypharmacy increases the likelihood \nof drug interactions, complicates dosing schedules, and results in \nreduced medication adherence, particularly in the setting of HF [53]; \npolypharmacy is an important contributor to patients\u2019 risk for poor \noutcomes. Older patients with multiple comorbidities are especially \nsusceptible to excessive medication burdens that increase their risk of \nside effects and drug interactions [2,54].\nThe impact of these elements on risks for poor outcomes \npostdischarge has been evaluated for patients with HF. Among the \nelderly, increased short-term mortality (i.e., in-hospital or \u2264 30 days \npostdischarge) and risk for readmission has been a consistent finding \n[30,31]. Elderly (median age >75 years) patients with HF have had a \nrate of readmission or death of 26% within 90 days [55], and a 1-year \nmortality rate of nearly 50% [2,54]. Patients with HF with preserved \nejection fraction are often elderly and at higher risk for poor \noutcomes [56]. Accordingly, increasing age has been used in many \nrisk-prediction models for the combined end point of readmission \nor death [57].\nA greater burden of comorbidities increases the risk of 30 and \n90 day readmission for AHF, as demonstrated by composite indices, \nsuch as the Charlson score [30,55].

Although readmission rates appear \nto be independent of presenting BP, elevated systolic BP at the time of \nadmission and discharge in patients hospitalized with ADHF correlates \ninversely with in-hospital and postdischarge mortality [29,58].  In \nanother study, both abnormally low and abnormally high systolic and \ndiastolic BP levels at discharge were associated with increased rates \nof 1-year mortality following discharge for ADHF [59]. These results \nsuggest that hospital discharge offers an opportunity to identify \npatients with low BP readings who may benefit from more frequent \nmonitoring in addition to identifying patients with high BP readings \nwho may benefit from escalated therapy [59]. Diabetes mellitus has \nbeen reported in approximately half of Medicare beneficiaries with \nHF in the United States [3], and has been associated with poor long-\nterm outcomes in patients hospitalized for AHF [6,19,60].\nNon-adherence to medication or diet and low health literacy also \nnegatively impact long-term survival following hospitalization for \nAHF. Medication non-adherence has been identified as a precipitating \ncause of decompensation, albeit associated with reduced in-hospital \nmortality [18,19]. Unsurprisingly, non-adherence to follow-up care \nhas been linked with increased readmission risk [61]. Similarly, lower \nhealth literacy has been found to be independently associated with \na significantly increased risk of mortality, even after adjusting for \ndemographic and clinical variables (P=0.001) [62,63].\nBased on the initial clinical evaluation, patients may be broadly \ngrouped into 2 categories: (1) low risk of poor outcomes; or (2) high \nrisk of poor outcomes due to underlying comorbidities. Further \nevaluation may improve risk stratification; to be useful in clinical \npractice, any additional assessments must be simple to perform at \nthe bedside. Risk-assessment tools: Multivariable predictive models \ncalculate clinical risk scores by incorporating variables known to \nbe associated with increased risk of an adverse outcome. In such \nmodels, relative weights are assigned to each variable to calculate \nan outcome probability [64]. The calculated clinical risk score may \nbe used to estimate patient prognosis. Many risk-prediction tools \nhave been developed to estimate risks for in-hospital mortality \n[65-67] and postdischarge mortality or rehospitalization [58,68-\n70] following admission for HF in the United States. A major \nlimitation is the complexity of the calculations, which makes their \nuse at bedside frequently impractical [65]. The American College of \nCardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) \nguideline for the management of HF indicates that several validated \nmultivariable risk scores can be useful to estimate subsequent risk of \nmortality in hospitalized patients with HF (Table 3) [3]. Although \na heterogeneous set of variables has been incorporated into the \npredictive models, age, blood pressure, sodium concentration, and \nrenal function are included in most [71]. Natriuretic peptide levels \nare included in one; and the 2017 American College of Cardiology \n(ACC)/AHA/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) update to \nthe ACCF/AHA guideline states that baseline measurements of \nnatriuretic peptides, cardiac troponins, or both, are useful [72]. These \nbiomarkers may be effective when used in conjunction with clinical \nrisk tools and will likely be integrated into new risk models [70,71,73].\nClinical risk-prediction tools have also been developed to \nestimate the risk of readmission following hospitalization for \nAHF [30,74]. Although many established clinical predictors of HF \nreadmission are available, a well-performing risk model has proven to \nbe difficult to create [30,74]; ACCF/AHA guidelines note clinical risk \nscores have not performed well in estimating the risk of readmission \n[3]. This difficulty may be related to the impact of factors beyond \nclinical and demographic patient characteristics on readmission \nrisk [74]. The use of clinical scores for risk stratification may best be \nconsidered as a supplement to, rather than replacement of, clinical \njudgment regarding decision making for individuals with HF [64]. \nFurthermore, clinicians should take clinical factors not included \nin risk scores into consideration, such as end-organ damage. The \npresence of LVEF <40%, elevated cardiac troponins, which are \nmarkers of myocardial damage, and brain natriuretic peptides have \nbeen associated with increased in-hospital mortality, postdischarge \nmortality, and the composite of readmission and mortality in patients \nwith AHF [75,76]. Abnormal liver function test results at baseline, or \nat any point during hospitalization, are predictive of mortality and HF \nrehospitalization [77]. Another factor that has not been incorporated \nin most risk scores is the length of hospital stay, which has been \nassociated with poor outcomes postdischarge for patients with AHF \n[13]. A retrospective analysis of the Value of Endothelin Receptor \nInhibition With Tezosentan in Acute Heart Failure Studies-1 and -2 \n(VERITAS-1 and -2; NCT00525707 and NCT00524433) observed \nthat longer lengths of hospital stay were associated with higher rates \nof 10-day readmission and 90-day mortality; these increased risks \nwere mediated by the occurrence of in-hospital worsening HF [78].\nNontraditional Risk Factors: Social elements in an individual \npatient\u2019s life are also important for estimating the risk of poor \nAHF outcomes. Socioeconomic and psychosocial factors influence \na patient\u2019s ability to adhere to their HF medication regimens and \nfollow-up care, which may, in turn, affect long-term outcomes \n[19]. Indeed, among patients hospitalized for HF, having a lower \nsocioeconomic status and being a recipient of Medicaid have been \nlinked with higher risk of poor outcomes [79-83], as have broader \nfactors, including living alone, lack of social and/or family support, \nand social instability [61,82,84]. For these patient groups, risk models \nfor predicting readmission may have only limited use in practice \nbecause the variability among stressful life experiences may outweigh \nthe contributions of traditional risk factors [11]. Thus, when \nestimating postdischarge risk of poor outcomes, considering social \ndeterminants of health may be prudent and more intensive follow-up \nplans for high-risk patients may be necessary [61,82,85,86].\nManagement of AHF Postdischarge\nThe use of optimized Guideline-Directed Evaluation and \nManagement (GDEM) for chronic HF is important following an \nepisode of AHF to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Ensuring \nthat patients receive optimized GDEM postdischarge requires the \ndevelopment of an effective transition and follow-up plan before \ndischarge [3]. In addition to the initiation and optimization of GDEM, \nthe ACCF/AHA guideline recommends that clinicians address: (1) \nthe precipitant causes of HF decompensation and any barriers to care \ntransitions; (2) volume overload and symptomatic hypotension; (3) \nrenal function and electrolyte abnormalities; (4) any comorbidities; \n(5) patient education, including self-care, emergency plans, and the \nimportance of adherence; and (6) the need for palliative or hospice \ncare [3]. Unfortunately, this robust armamentarium of interventions \nis difficult to implement in routine clinical practice [87,88]. Therefore, \nmultidisciplinary HF management programs are recommended for \npatients at increased risk for rehospitalization [3]. Risk stratification \nshould guide postdischarge monitoring, follow-up, and the need for \ndischarge to long-term-care facilities [3,89]."

In \naddition, the use of vasodilator combination therapy has been \nrecommended to reduce morbidity and mortality in black patients \n[3]. A subgroup analysis of clinical trials from the 1980s to 1990s \nsuggested that black patients had preferentially favorable clinical \noutcomes to vasodilator therapies that targeted the vascular \nendothelium (Vasodilator\u2013Heart Failure Trials I and II) [90,91]. A \nrandomized clinical trial designed to test this observation-the 2004 \nAfrican-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) found that Fixed-\nDose Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine (FDIH) combination therapy \nadded to ACE inhibitor therapy provided a robust reduction in the \nrisk for hospitalization, mortality, and morbidity in a black patient \ncohort [88,92-95]. Consequently, FDIH is strongly recommended \nfor black patients with New York Heart Association classes III-IV \nHF with reduced ejection fraction receiving optimal therapy with \nACE inhibitors and beta blockers, unless contraindicated (class of \nrecommendation: I; level of evidence: A) [3,72].\nMore recent therapeutic advances include the introduction of \nthe Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/\nvalsartan, and ivabradine, a sinoatrial node modulator [72,96]. \nThe 2017 guideline update now recommends ARNI therapy as the \npreferred approach in suitable patients with renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone-system inhibition and who are receiving an ACE inhibitor \nor angiotensin receptor blocker to further reduce both morbidity and \nmortality [72]. In a randomized clinical trial, sacubitril/valsartan \nreduced the composite end point of cardiovascular death or HF \nhospitalization by 20% compared with enalapril [25]. Additionally, \nin a randomized clinical trial in patients who were hospitalized \nfor ADHF and were hemodynamically stable prior to initiating \ntreatment, sacubitril/valsartan provided a greater reduction in levels \nof N-terminal pro-BNP than enalapril, with a greater reduction in \nN-terminal pro-BNP concentration evident as early as week 1 [97]. \nFurthermore, in this trial, the risk of the composite end point of \nserious clinical events (death, rehospitalization for HF, implantation \nof a left ventricular device, and listing for heart transplant) was \nsignificantly reduced in patients receiving sacubitril/valsartan \ncompared with enalapril. To date, we can't be sure if the outcomes are \nmirrored in black patients as the representation in the study cohort \nwas abysmal and included medicine practices that may differ between \ncountries. Although the relative benefit of FDIH was more robust than \nsuggested by ARNI therapy, the combination of ARNI and FDIH has \nnot been tested, and the guidelines recommend careful monitoring of \nBP response. As such, it is unclear which agent to start first to achieve \noptimal evidence based outcomes. Ivabradine is recommended to \nreduce HF hospitalization for patients with symptomatic New York \nHeart Association class II-III stable chronic HF with reduced ejection \nfraction who are already receiving optimized GDEM and are in sinus \nrhythm with a heart rate \u2265 70 beats per minute at rest [72].\nExciting new therapies are in the pipeline. Some study the \nbenefit of treating iron in those with deficiency anemia. Some \ncenter on mechanical techniques such as Enhanced Extracorporeal \nCounterpulsation (EECP) that may show promise in oxygen delivery \nand enhanced exercise tolerance. Risk factor modification remains \nparamount. In particular, diabetes therapies with inhibitors of \nSodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2i) have reduced worsening \nHF requiring IV therapy, and cardiovascular death possibly as a class \neffect as demonstrated in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with \nIn-hospital mortality Postdischarge mortality\nRisk score Variables Risk score Variables\nAdhere [65]\n\u2022 SBP \n\u2022 BUN \n\u2022 Serum creatinine\nEFFECT: 30-day  \nand 1-year mortality [68]\n\u2022 Age \n\u2022 Respiratory rate \n\u2022 SBP \n\u2022 Urea nitrogen \n\u2022 Sodium  \n\u2022 Cerebrovascular disease \n\u2022 Dementia \n\u2022 COPD \n\u2022 Hepatic cirrhosis \n\u2022 Cancer \n\u2022 Hemoglobin\nOptimize-Hf [66]\n\u2022 Age \n\u2022 Heart rate \n\u2022 SBP \n\u2022 Sodium  \n\u2022 Serum creatinine \n\u2022 HF as primary  \ncause of hospitalization \n\u2022 LVSD\nOPTIMIZE-HF: 60-day  \nmortality [58]\n\u2022 Age \n\u2022 Weight \n\u2022 SBP \n\u2022 Sodium \n\u2022 Creatinine \n\u2022 History of liver disease \n\u2022 History of depression \n\u2022 History of reactive airway disease\nGwtg-Hf [67]\n\u2022 SBP \n\u2022 BUN \n\u2022 Sodium \n\u2022 Age \n\u2022 Heart rate \n\u2022 Black race \n\u2022 COPD\nESCAPE: 6-month mortality [70]\n\u2022 Age  \n\u2022 BUN \n\u2022 6-minute walk test \n\u2022 Sodium \n\u2022 CPR/mechanical ventilation \n\u2022 Diuretic dose at discharge \n\u2022 No beta blocker at discharge \n\u2022 Discharge BNP\nTable 3: Clinical tools for predicting mortality risk in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF in the United States [3].\nADHERE: Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry; BNP: B-type Natriuretic Peptide; BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen; COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary \nDisease; CPR: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; GWTG-HF: Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry; EFFECT: Efficacy of Fluticasone Propionate/Formoterol \nin COPD Treatment; ESCAPE: Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness; HF: Heart Failure; LVSD: Left \nVentricular Systolic Dysfunction; OPTIMIZE-HF: Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure; SBP: Systolic Blood \nPressure"

Additional outcomes of composite of hospitalizations for HF \nand cardiovascular death, a composite of worsening renal function, \nand the change in baseline to 8 months using the Kansas City \nCardiomyopathy Questionnaire are likely benefited with SGLT2i, but \nvalidation among ethnic groups and effect in new versus chronic HF \nremain elusive. Promising is that we see benefit irrespective of LV \nfunction, another testament to the drug class [102,103,104].\nConclusion\nA wide range of demographic, clinical, and social factors place \nmany patients at high risk for poor outcomes after hospitalization \nfor AHF. Risk stratification is important to identify high-risk \npatients at hospital discharge who may benefit from more intensive \noutpatient management. Clinicians involved in the care of patients \nwith AHF need to be aware that nontraditional risk factors and \nbarriers to self-care, such as socioeconomic status, lack of social \nand/or family support, and social instability, should be taken into \nconsideration along with established clinical risk tools and biomarker \nmeasurements to determine the appropriate intensity of follow-up \ncare for their patients. Because each episode of hospitalization for \nAHF signals deteriorating function and increased risk of death, the \noptimal management of chronic HF to avoid acute decompensation \nis of paramount importance to minimize patient risks for poor \noutcomes. Proper identification of high-risk patients hospitalized \nfor AHF prior to discharge helps ensure that they receive adequate \nfollow-up and optimized GDEM to prevent hospitalizations and \ndisease progression.\nAcknowledgment\nMedical writing assistance with the preparation of this manuscript \nwas provided by Ruth Williams, MSc, and Brian Falcone, PhD, of \nOxford PharmaGenesis Inc., Newtown, PA, USA.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nReferences\n1.

It \nhas a global distribution, with an estimated 400 million infections annually, and its geographical \nspread continues to expand. More than 100 countries worldwide experience dengue outbreaks \n[2,4,5]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of dengue is \nrising. Over 7.6 million cases had been reported in 2024, including 3.4 million confirmed cases \nand more than 3,000 deaths. A significant surge has been observed in the Americas and Southeast \nAsia, as well as in several European countries [6] (Figure 1). This increase is attributed to factors \nsuch as climate change, rapid urbanization and increased human mobility, all of which contribute \nto the spread of the mosquito vectors responsible for dengue transmission [6]. In response, WHO \nlaunched a global strategic plan in October 2024 to combat dengue and other vector-borne diseases, \naiming to enhance surveillance, prevention, and outbreak response [6]. We present here a case of \nDENV infection in a Moroccan woman returning from Senegal and we discuss the importance of \nconsidering arboviral infections after traveling to an endemic area, diagnosis tools and the risk of \nthe emergence of DENV in Morocco due to climate change and increased population mobility.\n \nFigure 1: Notification rate of dengue cases over three months per 100,000 inhabitants, October-December \n2024 (7)."

She had spent two weeks in Senegal without \nantimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Her surgical history included two \ncesarean deliveries. No notable allergic or family history was reported. \nSymptoms began four days before admission, including fever (39\u00b0C), \ngeneralized abdominal pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, \nepistaxis, and generalized fatigue. On admission, the patient was \nconscious, hemodynamically and respiratory stable and febrile \n(39\u00b0C). The patient had intense headaches and was vomiting multiple \ntimes a day. Abdominal examination revealed a cesarean scar with a \nsoft abdomen, without palpable mass or hepatosplenomegaly.\nSkin and mucosal examination showed no jaundice or purpuric \nlesions but the presence of petechiae. No rash was observed. Other \nsystem examinations were unremarkable. An abdominal Computed \nTomography scan was unremarkable. Blood and urine samples were \ncollected, below is a summary of the results of the biological tests \nrequested during the hospitalization, showing the evolution of each \nparameter (Table 1).\nThe patient presented with leukopenia (2,000/\u03bcl), lymphopenia \n(900/\u03bcl), and neutropenia (800/\u03bcl), along with thrombocytopenia \n(69,000/\u03bcl) and a reduced hematocrit level (35.6%). Hepatic \ninvolvement was noted, with cholestasis and hepatic cytolysis. Testing \nfor Plasmodium spp. were negative. Viral serologies for HIV, HAV, \nHBV and HCV were also negative. Serologic testing for Epstein-Barr \nvirus (EBV) revealed positive IgG anti-EBNA and IgG anti-VCA, \nwith negative IgM anti-VCA, indicating past infection. Similarly, \ncytomegalovirus (CMV) serology showed positive IgG and negative \nIgM, suggesting a prior exposure. Arbovirus screening was negative \nfor Chikungunya and Zika viruses. However, dengue serology \nshowed positive IgM and IgG, indicative of an active infection. Blood \nand urine PCR confirmed the presence of DENV RNA. \nUnder symptomatic treatment, the patient\u2019s condition improved \nprogressively, with normalization of platelet count, white blood cells \nand hematocrit levels. She had a favorable clinical evolution and was \ndischarged on 11/19/2024. \nDiscussion \nThe DENV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus \nbelonging to the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. Other \nnotable arboviruses in this family include the Japanese encephalitis \nvirus (JEV), the West Nile virus (WNV) and the yellow fever virus \n(YFV) [1]. Four distinct DENV serotypes [1-4] have been identified \nworldwide, each with unique antigenic properties. Additionally, a \nfifth serotype (DENV-5) was first detected in the blood of a patient in \nSarawak, Malaysia, in 2007 [3].\nDengue is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected \nfemale mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, particularly Aedes aegypti and \nAedes albopictus [2]. Recently, countries such as Senegal, Burkina \nFaso, Nigeria, and Ethiopia have reported significant case numbers, \naccording to Africa CDC data [13]. The WHO reports a ninefold \nincrease in dengue infections across Africa in 2023 compared to \n2019 [14]. This epidemiological trend underscores the critical need \nfor Moroccan clinicians to systematically consider arboviral diseases \nin their differential diagnoses, as these infections continue to expand \nacross Africa and globally. \nPrevious studies have suggested that viral factors contribute \nto the pathogenesis of this disease, including the viral NS1 antigen \nand its antibodies, viral variations and virulence, sub-genomic RNA \nand the presence of cross-reactive memory T cells [4]. In humans, a \ndengue serotype provides lifelong immunity against reinfection with \nthe same serotype but only temporary and partial immunity against \nother serotypes. Due to the phenomenon of antibody-dependent \nenhancement, reinfection with a different serotype can increase the \nrisk of developing a severe, potentially fatal form [1,2]. The clinical \nmanifestations of dengue infection vary significantly, ranging from \nasymptomatic infection to severe hemorrhagic forms with multiorgan \nfailure and death in up to 13% of untreated cases [2]. Three clinical \nforms of dengue are distinguished: the mild form, known as dengue \nfever (DF); the severe form, or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), \ncharacterized by hematomas and severe thrombocytopenia; and the \nmost critical stage, dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DSS involves \ncoagulation abnormalities, increased vascular fragility, high plasma \nleakage, and capillary permeability leading to hypovolemic shock and \nan increased risk of multiorgan failure [5]. Our patient, a 39-year-\nold woman returning from an endemic region, exhibited classic \nsymptoms of dengue, including high fever, headache, abdominal \npain, nausea, and vomiting.\nLaboratory findings revealed leukopenia, lymphopenia, \nthrombocytopenia, and hepatic cytolysis, consistent with early \ncritical phase, with risk of progression to severe dengue. Dengue most \noften resolves within a week. However, in 2 to 4% of cases, severe \nforms can occur suddenly after 3 to 5 days of illness progression. \nWhen this aggravation occurs, the outcome can rapidly become fatal. \nRisk factors for severe dengue include pregnancy (particularly in the \nthird trimester), extreme ages of life, and chronic conditions such \nas diabetes, obesity, heart failure, asthma, chronic liver diseases and \nmajor sickle cell syndromes [5].\nDiagnosis of DENV infection in our patient was confirmed by \nblood positive IgM and IgG antibodies (Dengue Virclia\u00ae IgG / IgM \nMonotest, Vircell) and blood detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR \n(RealStar\u00ae Dengue RT-PCR Kit 3.0, Altona Diagnostics).

However, the clinical presentation of dengue is \nnonspecific and overlaps with other febrile illnesses, making biological \nconfirmation crucial. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention - United States) recommends two primary strategies for \nearly diagnosis (within the first 7 days after symptom onset) [2]: \n\u2022\t Rapid immunochromatographic antigen tests targeting the \nnon-structural glycoprotein 1 (NS1), combined with IgM detection \nby Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). \n\u2022\t Nucleic acid amplification tests (real-time RT-PCR) \ncombined with IgM serology. \nHowever, each of these methods has significant limitations. For \nexample, although IgM ELISA is often considered the preferred \ndiagnostic method, IgM antibodies are only detectable from 4 to 5 \ndays after the onset of symptoms and for about 12 weeks.\nThis means that IgM ELISA tests could provide false-negative \nresults during the critical early days of the illness. Conversely, \nIgM antibodies sometimes lack specificity, which can lead to false \npositives due to non-specific reactivity (Malaria, Typhoid fever, \nCytomegalovirus\u2026) [2]. Seroneutralization tests, which require the \nuse of infectious viruses and are systematically performed at the CNR, \nhave better specificity compared to traditional ELISA or CLIA tests. \nOn the other hand, The NS1 antigen is detectable from 1 to 2 days \nafter the onset of symptoms, with a peak typically between the 3rd and \n7th day. The NS1 antigen test offers several advantages, such as low \ncost, ease of use and rapid results, making it effective in endemic areas \nwith high incidence and limited resources. However, the sensitivity \nof available NS1 antigen tests varies significantly depending on the \nDENV serotype, with an overall sensitivity of 71% (95% CI: 61\u201379%). \nThis sensitivity fluctuates by serotype: ranging from 50% to 90.9% for \nDENV-1, 38.5% to 85.7% for DENV-2, 46.7% to 91.3% for DENV-\n3, and 21.7% to 87% for DENV-4 [15]. Additionally, sensitivity \nmay be further reduced during secondary infections . In this regard, \ncombining direct and indirect methods improves diagnostic accuracy \n[2]. Commercial ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoAssay) kits for \nDENV NS1 antigen detection, such as Platelia\u00ae Dengue NS1 (Bio-\nRad) and Pan E-Dengue Early ELISA\u00ae, Panbio, offer automated, \nrapid, and user-friendly testing solutions. These assays demonstrate \nhigh analytical performance with specificity ranging from 97.9% to \n100% and sensitivity between 58.1% and 93.3% according to HAS \ndengue guidelines. Additionally, combined rapid diagnostic tests \n(RDTs) capable of simultaneous detection of NS1 antigen and anti-\nDengue IgG/IgM antibodies - including the One Step Dengue NS1Ag \n+ IgG/IgM Test\u00ae (SD Bioline) and Panbio Early Rapid NS1 + Panbio \nDengue Duo Cassette\u00ae (Panbio), are now available, with reported \nsensitivity exceeding 88%.\nRT-PCR for detecting DENV RNA is considered the most \nsensitive and specific method. However, its performance depends on \nviral kinetics, viral RNA becomes undetectable beyond 5 days after \nsymptom onset, potentially leading to false-negative results if testing \noccurs too late. The WHO recommends specimen collection within \nthis 5-day window for optimal RT-PCR detection of DENV [16]. RT-\nPCR offers many advantages, such as the ability to serotype DENV \nand perform differential diagnosis of various arbovirus infections. \nFurthermore, RT-PCR technology is rapidly evolving and an \nincreasing number of manufacturers are offering closed, ready-to-use \nsystems that are simple to operate and capable of providing results in \njust one hour. Some ready-to-use kits that provide results quickly are \nthe Altona RealStar\u00ae Dengue RT-PCR Kit 2.0 and the ZIKV/DENV/\nCHIKV REALTIME PCR KIT [2]. \nThe risk of the emergence of indigenous dengue cases and \nits spread in Morocco is influenced by several factors. Although \nAedes aegypti, the primary vector of the dengue virus (DENV), has \nnot been reported in Morocco, Aedes albopictus has been detected \nin certain regions, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas. In \nSeptember 2015, Aedes albopictus was identified for the first time in \nthe Rabat region. Subsequent studies confirmed its ability to transmit \nseveral arboviruses, including DENV, chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika \n(ZIKV), and yellow fever (YFV) [17]. Predictive models suggest \nthat northwestern and central parts of Morocco, especially urban \nareas, provide favorable habitats for Aedes albopictus, increasing the \nrisk of local transmission of these viruses [17,18]. Its geographical \nexpansion may be facilitated by favorable climatic conditions such \nas high temperatures and rainfall, which support mosquito breeding. \nIn Morocco, especially during the summer months, the increasingly \nwarm climate promotes the proliferation of mosquito vectors.\nRecent climatic data shows a significant warming trend in \nMorocco, with temperatures rising by about 1.1\u00b0C between 1981 and \n2016. 2020 and 2022 being the hottest years on record, exceeding the \n1981\u20132010 average by 1.4\u00b0C and 1.63\u00b0C, respectively. \nRainy periods further encourage mosquito settlement in urban \nenvironments, where conditions like stagnant water create ideal \nbreeding grounds for their development. \nIn parallel, in recent years, the number of Moroccan tourists \ntraveling to countries where dengue is endemic has increased \nexponentially [12]. Economic and diplomatic relations between \nMorocco and various countries in Africa and Asia have also \nstrengthened significantly. Consequently, the risk of importing \npathogens into Morocco from abroad and local transmission has \nconsiderably increased. Moreover, the organization of international \nevents like the Africa Cup of Nations in 2025 and the World Cup in \n2030 brings thousands of visitors from \ncountries where dengue is endemic (such as Southeast Asia, \nLatin America, etc.). This increases the risks of imported cases and \nthe introduction of the virus into the local population. Additionally, \nthe rise in international travel, particularly for large-scale events, can \nlead to the importation of dengue cases. These cases could become \npotential vectors for the epidemic if local mosquitoes are present and \ncapable of transmitting the virus. \nAlthough Morocco has not yet reported any indigenous cases of \ndengue, the presence of Aedes Aegypti and the increase in international \ntravel put the country at an increased risk of the disease's emergence. \nMorocco's epidemiological surveillance, although strengthened in \nrecent years, needs to be adapted to detect any suspected dengue cases \nearly.\nRapid screening, confirmation of cases, and prompt response \nare essential to prevent the spread of the virus. Public and healthcare \nprofessional awareness is also an important factor. Furthermore, \nmonitoring mosquito habitats and control measures (such as \neliminating stagnant water and spraying insecticides) is crucial. \nProtective measures (such as using mosquito nets, repellents, etc.) \nshould be encouraged, especially in high-risk areas. \nFinally, there is no antiviral therapy available for DENV infection. \nHowever, two dengue vaccines have been approved and are available"

We report the unusual case of an otherwise healthy teenager diagnosed with \nacute typhlitis and found to have necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis on multidisciplinary \nworkup. A 17-year-old female was admitted for 1 month of worsening lower abdominal pain, \nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss. She was recently admitted at an outside hospital \nfor acute typhlitis diagnosed on computerized tomography (CT) which improved with empiric \nantibiotics. Repeat CT on admission demonstrated marked wall inflammation at the ileocecal valve \nwith bilateral renal abnormalities and right lower quadrant (RLQ) adenopathy, raising concern \nfor lymphoma. Pediatric gastroenterology, hematology-oncology, and surgery were consulted. \nColonoscopy demonstrated a hard mass arising circumferentially from the appendiceal orifice into \nthe cecum; snare or resection was deferred due to concern for perforation. Non-specific changes \nwere shown on mass surface and surrounding intestinal mucosa biopsies. Laparoscopic surgical \nbiopsy of the peri-appendiceal lymph node demonstrated necrotizing granulomas without signs of \nan oncologic process. Testing for bacterial and fungal etiologies were sent. After extensive discussion \nwith the family and multidisciplinary team, the decision was made to repeat outpatient imaging after \ndischarge to determine a management plan, including possible surgical resection of the ileocecal \nvalve. Follow-up CT demonstrated an improved inflammatory process consistent with typhlitis \nand no evidence of mass. No further intervention or follow-up was planned. Multidisciplinary \ncollaboration led to shared decision-making with the family to delay intervention which ultimately \nled to avoidance of ileocecal valve resection with potentially long-term complications.\nKeywords: Typhlitis, Cecal inflammation, Necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis, Pediatric \ngastroenterology, Adolescent case\nNikhil Crain*, Victoria Martucci, Braden Olsen, Kelly Maloney, Lindsey Gumer, Andrew Boies\nUniversity of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Aurora, CO 80045, United Sates\nOPEN ACCESS\n *Correspondence:\nNikhil Crain, Children\u2019s Hospital \nColorado, University of Colorado \nSchool of Medicine, Aurora, CO, 13001 \nE 17th Pl, Campus Box C290, Aurora, \nCO 80045;\nE-mail: nikhil.crain@childrenscolorado.\norg\nReceived Date: 26 Aug 2025\nAccepted Date: 10 Sep 2025\nPublished Date: 11 Sep 2025\nCitation: \nCrain N, Martucci V, Olsen B, Maloney \nK, Gumer L, Boies A.

The most common \nsymptoms are fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain; however, presentation is often obscured by \nnon-specific symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension [1-4]. Typhlitis, also called \nneutropenic enterocolitis, is often associated with malignancy or immunosuppression in the setting \nof intense chemotherapy, making it uncommon in immunocompetent patients [1]. \nWhile pathogenesis is unclear, injury or ulceration to the intestinal surface appears to lead to a \ncascade of mucosal disruption, wall edema, and vessel engorgement with vulnerability to intramural \nbacterial infection [1]. Mortality ranges from 2.2% to 48% but can be as high as 60% without early \nrecognition [4-5]. We report a case of typhlitis in an otherwise healthy teenager which warranted \ncollaboration between primary and specialist teams due to its unusual presentation.\nCase Description\nA 17-year-old previously healthy female presented with 1 month of lower abdominal pain \nwith worsening nausea, non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting, and non-bloody diarrhea for 5 days. \nAbdominal pain was described as stabbing and intermittent. Poor oral intake was secondary to \npost-prandial nausea and vomiting. Weight loss of 1.8 kg (4lb) was reported over the prior 2 weeks. \nThe patient endorsed intermittent chills, but denied fever, night sweats, fatigue, or upper respiratory \ninfection symptoms. The patient was up-to-date on all vaccinations and attended high school locally. \nShe denied recent travel and lived at home with her family, 1 dog, and 3 cats. \nThree days prior to presentation, the patient was admitted for 2 days at an outside hospital"

Physical exam was significant for periumbilical abdominal \ntenderness to palpation and delayed capillary refill of 2-3 seconds. \nLabs were notable for elevated creatinine 1.4 mg/dL [0.42-0.90], \naspartate aminotransferase (AST) 33 U/L [5-30], uric acid 8.8 mg/dL \n(repeat the next day 8.3 mg/dL) [3-5.9], erythrocyte sedimentation \nrate (ESR) 39 mm/Hr [0-20], and C-reactive protein (CRP) 2.8 mg/\ndL [0-0.9]; fecal calprotectin was sent. Complete blood count (CBC), \ncomplete metabolic panel (CMP), magnesium, phosphorus, and \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were normal. Urinalysis was non-\ninfectious, and urine pregnancy test and gastrointestinal panel (GIP) \nwere negative. Chest radiography was unremarkable. \nCT abdomen and pelvis with contrast demonstrated marked focal \nnon-obstructive wall thickening at the ileocecal valve with patchy \ndecreased density within bilateral upper renal poles, left greater than \nright as well as the left lower pole, raising concern for pyelonephritis, \nand RLQ adenopathy raising concern for lymphoma (Figure 1A). \nImaging was reviewed by pediatric gastroenterology (GI), pediatric \nhematology-oncology, and pediatric surgery teams. Given the \nconstellation of persistent symptoms along with concerning CT scan \nand lab results, the initial diagnosis of typhlitis at the outside hospital \nwas revisited, and the differential diagnosis was broad at this time \n(Table 1). The patient initially continued her home oral antibiotics \nbut after one dose of each, they were held to allow for further workup. \nDue to inability to tolerate oral intake, she was started on IV fluids. \nOn hospital day (HOD) 3, the patient underwent an endoscopy \nand colonoscopy with pediatric GI, which identified mild gastritis \nand a hard, malignant-appearing and multilobular mass in the \ncecum (Figure 2A-C). The mass demonstrated erythema, edema, and \nfriability with associated erythema at the ileocecal valve near the base \nof the mass; however, no bleeding was identified. The mass was not \namenable to direct biopsy because of its location, but cold forceps \nbiopsy was performed for collection of surface tissue. Mucosal biopsy \nnearby the mass demonstrated acute colitis with crypt microabscess \nformation and granulomatous inflammation associated with crypt \nrupture, though without significant crypt architectural disorder. \nVisualization of the remainder of terminal ileum to distal rectum was \nnormal with unremarkable biopsies. No Helicobacter organisms were \nseen on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections.\nOn HOD5, due to concern for lymphoma, the patient underwent \nlaparoscopic mesenteric lymph node biopsy with pediatric surgery. \nRemoval of omental adhesions to the RLQ exposed a firm round \nmass coming from the cecum adjacent to the terminal ileum, while \nthe remainder of the bowel appeared normal. Enlargement of \nmesenteric lymph nodes was observed, and the largest and closest \nperi-appendiceal lymph node to the cecum was removed for surgical \npathology. The specimen demonstrated necrotizing granulomatous \nlymphadenitis without evidence of malignancy.\nOn HOD7, the infectious disease team was consulted and \nsuggested additional workup to rule out rare infectious etiologies \nof her abdominal findings. Given the patient\u2019s cat exposure, bovine \nexposure, and history of travel to Mexico 10 months prior, the \npatient underwent serum testing for Mycoplasma and Bartonella \nand urine antigen testing for Coccidioides and Histoplasma.

After extensive \ndiscussion with the patient, family and multidisciplinary team, it \nwas decided that the patient was clinically stable for discharge with \na plan to follow up in approximately 2 weeks for repeat CT scan. \nFurther management, including potential surgical resection of the \nmass, would be decided pending results of those scans. At the time \nof discharge (HOD8), abdominal pain was well-controlled and the \npatient had good toleration of oral intake with acetaminophen for \npain and ondansetron for nausea as needed. \nTwo weeks after discharge, the patient endorsed only 1 day of mild \nabdominal pain since discharge with normal intake and elimination. \nRepeat CT abdomen pelvis with contrast demonstrated improved \ninflammatory findings at the cecum consistent with typhlitis. There \nwas no obvious evidence of mass, and terminal ileum and kidneys had \na normal appearance (Figure 1B). Based on the improvement seen on \nher repeat imaging, the GI and general surgery teams recommended \nnot to proceed with further surgical intervention or biopsy.\nAt 2-month GI follow-up, repeat fecal calprotectin was 31.1 \nmcg/g (versus initial 84.6 mcg/g). Given the reassuring imaging and \nlab findings and clinical resolution of symptoms, no further imaging \nor intervention, including repeat colonoscopy, was recommended. \nDiscussion\nTyphlitis is a subtle diagnosis, and there is scant research \nthat describes the frequency and pathogenesis of the disease, \nespecially among immunocompetent patients [6]. Typically, \nimmunosuppression confirmed by history or laboratory testing in \nthe appropriate clinical context is generally thought to tip off typhlitis \nas a potential diagnosis [7]. However, typhlitis screening labs have \nalso been shown to be non-specific [1]. Given the evolving workup, \nour multidisciplinary team was challenged to discern the etiology of \nher symptoms. \nIn our patient, the absence of B symptoms along with normal \nCBC and LDH were reassuring against bone marrow suppression \nor rapid cell growth to suggest underlying malignancy, such as non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma. Chest radiography was also reassuring against \nmediastinal mass. While initial hyperuricemia gave pause early in the \ndiagnostic workup, elevated levels could be explained by her mild \nacute kidney injury demonstrated on her spike in creatinine which \nwas likely secondary to dehydration, which normalized with IV \nfluids. Nevertheless, initial impressive CT findings that demonstrated \nbilateral kidney involvement, suggesting possible renal infiltration, \nand mesenteric lymphadenopathy raised concern for lymphoma. \nWhile kidney findings on CT were postulated to stem from a \ndeveloping pyelonephritis, the patient had a bland urinalysis and lack \nof flank pain or dysuria.\nWhile CT findings before colonoscopy could be explained by \ninflammatory bowel disease favoring Crohn's disease given ileocecal \nvalve involvement versus infectious colitis, there was no evidence \nof these diagnoses given normal mucosal appearance during the \nprocedure and normal subsequent biopsies. It was suspected that \ncolitis-type symptoms and diarrhea were related to inflammation \nseen on imaging and irritation surrounding the mass seen on \ncolonoscopy. Because typhlitis is conventionally seen in cytopenic \npatients, colonoscopy is seldom indicated due to risk of bleeding \nand perforation [8-9]. Hence, our case may be a rare example of \nthe appearance of typhlitis and extent that bowel wall inflammation \non gross examination. At the time, visualization of a malignant-\nappearing appendiceal mass was worrisome irrespective of the \nnon-specific intestinal biopsies, prompting the decision to proceed \nwith peri-appendiceal lymph node sampling for further pathology \ndelineation.\nWhen surgical lymph node biopsy demonstrated necrotizing \ngranulomas without evidence of lymphoma, it was deemed \nwarranted to expand testing for bacterial and fungal etiologies \ngiven the impressive findings on colonoscopy and CT imaging. \nVexingly, infectious workup was unremarkable. Generally, the \nliterature attributes typhlitis to various offending organisms, such \nas anaerobes, Candida species, gram-positive cocci, gram-negative \nbacilli. Moreover, infections are often polymicrobial and can progress \nto bacteremia if the bowel wall is perforated [5].   \nExtensive discussion was had among the team and family to \ndetermine next steps, given her inconclusive workup. While lymph \nnode biopsy was reassuring against lymphoma, only surface tissue was \ncollected of the observed mass, and there was a strong consideration \nof surgical resection to clarify definitive pathology. The hospital \nmedicine and GI teams had continued concern for malignancy \nbased on the gross appearance of the mass on colonoscopy, but the \noncology team felt the reassuring lab workup made lymphoma less \nlikely. Given its location, the benefits of analyzing direct tissue of the \nconcerning mass were weighed against the risks of surgery, which \nincluded the removal of the ileocecal valve and potential long-term \nadverse effects. Ultimately, shared decision-making led to delaying \nintervention and planning for serial CT scanning, which is suggested \nas the main criterion for establishing the diagnosis and monitoring \nprogression of typhlitis [10-13]. Abdominal ultrasound, which \nin our case was normal, is generally the primary mode of imaging \ndue to its speed and sensitivity for appendicitis, a key differential \ndiagnosis, before proceeding to CT imaging [10]. Conservative \ntreatment, including bowel rest, IV antibiotics, and close monitoring, \nis the primary recommendation in the treatment of typhlitis; early \ndetection is paramount to avoid surgery which can raise the risk of \nmorbidity [1,14]. \nThere are few examples in the literature of otherwise healthy \nyoung patients diagnosed with typhlitis. Reyes et al. described the \ncase of a 25-year-old female with no significant past medical history \nwho presented non-specific complaints of recurrent RLQ pain and \ndiarrhea with strikingly similar cecal thickening on CT imaging \nto our patient; the patient improved with bowel rest, pain control, \nand IV antibiotics for presumed appendicitis at the time [15]. Ufuk \net al. shared the case of typhlitis in a 60-year-old female diagnosed \nwith typhlitis demonstrated on CT in the setting of COVID-19 \npneumonia; while the patient had no history of immunosuppression, \npancytopenia at the time was thought to result from bone marrow \nsuppression from viral infection [16]. Further attention should be \nbrought to the potential for typhlitis to occur in healthy patients and \nremain a differential diagnosis and possible mimic for more likely \ndiagnoses of appendicitis or infectious colitis. \nConclusion\nThis report shares the rare example of typhlitis in a healthy \nteenager and reveals the discourse between our multidisciplinary team \nin the face of a challenging diagnosis. Typhlitis should be considered"

The administration of PedPRM, \nfollowed by dose optimization resulted in 9 patients attaining acceptable sleep duration (>7 h), sleep \nmaintenance (longest sleep episode >6 h) and sleep initiation (sleep onset latency <30 min). The \nother 3 patients attained acceptable sleep in two out of the 3 variables. Significant positive effects on \ndaytime behavior and parent satisfaction were noted in all reported cases.\nThus, real life evidence supports PedPRM as an effective and safe strategy for managing insomnia in \npediatric patients with ADHD.\nDelorme Richard1, Fefeu Mylene1, Moscoso Ana1, Acquaviva Eric1, Chavand-Gassier Aurelie2, \nLecendreux Michel3, Lanco Dosen Sandrine4 and Schroder Carmen5\n1Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Robert Debr\u00e9 University Hospital, Child brain institute, Paris Cit\u00e9 \nUniversity, APHP, Paris, France\n2Avenue Olbius Riquier 83400 Hy\u00e8res, France\n3Pediatric Sleep Center, Robert Debr\u00e9 University Hospital, AP-HP, Paris Cit\u00e9 University, Paris, France.\n4Hospital Center de Sambre - Avesnois (MAUBEUGE) (Centre hospitalier (Maubeuge) Maubeuge)\n5Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Excellent Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders STRAS&ND, \nInternational Research Centre for ChronoSomnology (CIRCSom), Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, \nFrance\nOPEN ACCESS\n *Correspondence:\nSchroder Carmen, Department of Child \nand Adolescent Psychiatry, Excellent \nCentre for Neurodevelopmental \nDisorders STRAS&ND, International \nResearch Centre for ChronoSomnology \n(CIRCSom), Strasbourg University \nHospital, Strasbourg, France,\nE-mail: schroderc@unistra.fr\nReceived Date: 20 Jul 2025\nAccepted Date: 04 Aug 2025\nPublished Date: 05 Aug 2025\nCitation: \nRichard D, Mylene F, Ana M, Eric \nA, Aurelie C-G, Michel L.

The ADHD/HD worldwide-pooled \nprevalence is around 5%, although this estimate is associated with significant variability [2-4]. Based \non US national representative data (2017-2022), the estimated ADHD incidence among children \nand adolescents aged 4-17 years is 10.28% [4]. \nUp to seventy percent of children with ADHD experience sleep disturbances [5,6] as opposed to \nonly twenty to thirty percent in children from the general population [6-8].

Several global guidelines \nrecommend the use of melatonin for sleep problems in children \nwith neurodevelopmental conditions including ADHD where sleep \nhygiene measures have been insufficient [22-26]. Over recent years \nseveral immediate-release melatonin formulations (IRM) have been \nauthorized in the EU/EEA for the treatment of sleep disorders in \nchildren and adolescents with ADHD ( https://www.medicines.org.\nuk/emc/product/10419/smpc#gref). Those formulations deliver  \nrapid, transient, high levels of melatonin that subside rapidly and \nthus predominantly improve sleep onset latency (SOL), but do \nalso cause earlier morning awakenings due to the phase-shifting \nchronobiotic effects of IR melatonin [18,27]. A pediatric appropriate \nprolonged-release minitablet formulation of melatonin (PedPRM) \nthat circumvents the fast clearance of the hormone by releasing it in \nthe gut over an extended period of time [28-31] was approved for \ninsomnia in children aged 2-18 years with ASD and NGD  and is now \napproved for children with ADHD ( https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/\nmedicines/human/EPAR/slenyto). Among children with ASD, the \nprevalence of clinically significant ADHD symptoms \u2013 defined as \ncausing a high degree of impairment in cognitive, social, and adaptive \nfunctioning - ranges from 29% to more than 40% [32]. Clinical trials \nof PedPRM in children and adolescents with ASD demonstrated \nimprovements in sleep duration (TST) and maintenance (longest \nsleep episode, LSE) as well as SOL, and subsequently in child\u2019s \nbehaviors and caregiver\u2019s quality of life [33-35]. PedPRM does not \nhave phase-shifting chronobiotic properties due to its bioavailability \n(circadian time zero) and thus, does not cause earlier morning \nawakenings. In previous studies, PedPRM was globally safe; the \nmost frequent treatment related adverse events were asthenia (6.3%), \nsomnolence (6.3%), and mood swings (4.2%) [36]. The recommended \nstarting dose for children with ASD is 2 mg once daily for 2 to 4 weeks, \nincreased to 5 mg and then 10 mg/day, regardless of age or weight, if \nthe pre-defined treatment success criteria (LSE >6 h, SOL <30 min \nand TST acceptable for their age) are not met [37].\nPedPRM indication was recently extended to children and \nadolescents with ADHD aged 6-17 and starting dose is 1 mg escalated \nto 10 once daily [38]. To evaluate the benefit of PedPRM in clinical \npractice, we present here a case series of 12 children and adolescents \nwith ADHD demonstrating the decision-making process involved in \nthe choice of PedPRM and dose effects on child\u2019s sleep and behavior \nas well as family satisfaction (detailed in Table 1).\nCase Presentation (C1-C12) (Table 1)\nC1 - 12-year-old male with ADHD, comorbid anxiety and \ninsomnia and treated with methylphenidate (MPH) for ADHD.\nC1 had difficulty falling asleep (SOL 60 min), frequent awakenings, \nand short sleep duration (TST 6.5-9 h), early morning awakenings \nwith fatigue, associated with increased ADHD symptoms.\nTreatment with PedPRM (2 mg, escalated to 5 mg after 2 \nmonths) led to significant improvement in the insomnia (SOL <30 \nmin, LSE ~ 9 h, and morning awakening at 7 a.m. with less fatigue). \nParents rep orted satisfaction with the quality of their child's sleep, \nand associated decrease in irritability, anxiety and emotional \ndysregulation.\nC2 - 7-year-old male diagnosed with ADHD, and comorbid \ndysgraphia, insomnia and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). He \nwas treated with MPH for ADHD. \nC2\u2019s sleep problems included difficulty falling and staying \nasleep with increased difficulty concentrating, restlessness, frequent \noutbursts of anger, and indirect endangerment. \nFollowing treatment with PedPRM 2 mg, SOL decreased from 60-\n90 min to <30 min, number of awakenings (NOA) from ~3 (30-60 \nmin each) to 1 per night (15-20 min each), LSE increased from 5 to \n7 h, with consequent improvement in ADHD symptoms and temper \ntantrums. Parents became less exhausted following their child's \nimproved sleep quality and behaviour.\nC3 - 8-year-old female diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 7 \nyears, with comorbid mild anxiety and learning disorder (dyslexia). \nShe exhibited a persistent pattern of inattention that impacted her \ndaily functioning at home and school, frequently making careless \nerrors, being easily distracted, and having difficulty coping with \nacademic demands. \nHer sub-threshold insomnia worsened after initiation of MPH \ntreatment (SOL 60-90 min, NOA 2-3/night 20-60 min each, TST 7-8 \nh, LSE ~4 h) with daytime tiredness. \nSleep hygiene optimization and adjustments to MPH yielded \nminimal improvements. Following 2 weeks of treatment with \nPedPRM, the child's sleep patterns significantly improved, (SOL 20-\n30 min, TST 8-9 h, LSE 6-7 h, NOA 0-1 per night for 5 min).\nMarked improvement was noted in the child\u2019s daytime behaviour, \nless fatigue and anxiety, with better attention and school performance. \nParents reported relief and satisfaction, noting they felt more rested \nand capable of managing daily tasks.\nC4 - 6-year-old male diagnosed with ADHD and mild anxiety at \nthe age of 5 years, and insomnia at the age of 6 years, with difficulties \nfalling and staying asleep and short sleep duration (LSE 60-120 min, \nTST 7-8 h per night, LSE 3 h and NOA 2-3 times per night, 10-60 \nmin each). C4 exhibited increased irritability, reduced attention span, \nand high hyperactivity during the day. A structured sleep hygiene \nprogram resulted in minimal improvements.  No pharmacological \nintervention for ADHD or insomnia was provided. \nTreatment with PedPRM 2 mg resulted in significant \nimprovements in the child\u2019s sleep patterns (SOL 20-30 min, 1-2 \nawakenings for ~5 min each, LSE 5-6 h, TST 8-9 h).  Parents \nreported a substantial improvement in children\u2019s ADHD symptoms \n(less irritable, more focused during school hours, and reduced \nhyperactivity) and their wellbeing. \nC5 - 13-year-old male diagnosed with ADHD, dyspraxia and \ninsomnia at the age of 10 years (SOL >3h, TST 4-5h, NOA 3-4 \nper night). Treatment with IRM did not improve the insomnia \nsymptoms. Following PedPRM 5 mg daily, sleep patterns markedly \nimproved (SOL 45 min, TST 9-10 h). IRM 1.5 mg spray resulted in \nfurther improvement in sleep initiation (SOL 20 min). \nHowever, the treatment was stopped because the family could not \nafford the costs.\nC6 - 8-year-old male diagnosed with insomnia at age 3 years, \nwith ADHD and difficulties in social cognition at age 6 years, and \ncomorbid ODD at age 7 years (SOL 60-80 min, TST 8 h, LSE 4-5 h,"

The \nchild was agitated, cried frequently, constantly refused to perform \ntasks and had many temper tantrums. Sleep hygiene training, and \nbehavioral therapy did not achieve significant improvement. \nIRM 1 mg treatment at age 5- 7 resulted in improved sleep onset \nand duration (SOL 20 min, TST 9 h). However, sleep maintenance \n(LSE and NOA) did not improve. Any other/additional sleep disorders \nwere excluded by overnight polysomnography. MPH treatment, \nwhich started at age 7, improved motor hyperactivity, impulsiveness \nand ODD behavior, but not sleeping pattern. \nPedPRM 2 mg, initiated at age 8 years led to a notable amelioration \nof insomnia (SOL 20 min, TST 10 h, LSE 9 h, NOA 0-1), improvement \nof emotional regulation, impulsiveness and ODD. Parents reported \nfull satisfaction with their child's night sleep and daytime behaviour. \nC7 - 6-year-old male diagnosed with insomnia at age 3 years and \nwith ADHD and comorbid learning difficulties at age 6 years. \nDue to insomnia (bedtime resistance, SOL 60 min, NOA 2-3/\nnight 15-20 min each, TST 7-8 h, LSE 5 h), the child exhibited daytime \ntiredness, was easily distracted at school, and unable to focus; and \nfrom early afternoon, he was cranky, crying, and getting into temper \ntantrums. \nPedPRM treatment (2 mg, escalated to 5 mg after a month), \nled to significant improvements in the child's sleep patterns (SOL \n5-10 min, TST 10 h, LSE 9 h, NOA 0-1 per night). The teacher \nobserved improvements in motor hyperactivity, impulsiveness and \nconcentration difficulties at school (Conner\u2019s rating scale). The \nchild was much less tired and cranky in the afternoon, and bedtime \nresistance was notably reduced. Parents reported high satisfaction \nfrom the child\u2019s sleep maintenance and behaviour during the day. \nThey feel that no ADHD treatment is needed for their child anymore.\nC8 - 7-year-old male diagnosed with sleep maintenance insomnia \n(TST 1-2 h, LSE 2 h, SOL 15 min, NOA 1) at age 28 months, and \nADHD with comorbid developmental delay, psychomotor instability \nand academic difficulties at age 4 years. \nAt age 5 years, the child started treatment with PedPRM (2 mg, \nescalated to 5 mg four months later) which led to a notable correction \nin all sleeping parameters (SOL 15 min, TST 10 h, LSE 10 h, NOA \n0). Parents reported improved well-being and satisfaction with their \nchild's sleeping pattern. Consequently, an amelioration of instability, \nconcentration, and step by step learning was notable. \nC9 - 7-year-old female diagnosed with insomnia at age 3 years, \nand with ADHD and comorbid ODD at age 4 years. \nPedPRM (2 mg escalated one year later to 3 mg) led to significant \nimprovement in the child's sleep patterns although the acceptable \nTST (> 8 h) was not reached. TST and LSE   improved from 2-3 to 6 \nh and NOA increased from 1 that terminated night sleep to 2-3 per \nnight, 5 min each.   \nC10 - 9-year-old male diagnosed with insomnia at age 4 years, \nand with ADHD at age 7 years, with comorbid learning and writing \ndifficulties, verbal and gestural tics.\nPedPRM (1 mg dose, escalated to 5 mg one year later ) led to \na significant improvement in the child's sleep patterns (TST was \nprolonged from 4 to 10 h, reaching the acceptable sleep duration \naccording to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) (TST >8h) and LSE \nimproved from 3 to 9 h. PedPRM improved the time to fall asleep and \nthe possibility to fall asleep again after midsleep night awakenings.\nC11 - 12-year-old male diagnosed with ADHD with comorbid \ndyslexia at age 6 years, and with insomnia at age 7 years. Treatment \nwith PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 3 mg a month later) led to a notable \nimprovement in all sleep parameters (SOL 20 min, TST 9 h, LSE \n4 h, NOA reduced from 4-6 to 2 per night). The child\u2019s behavior \nwas initially characterized by a high level of hyperactivity and lack \nof attention with a score of 35 on the ADHD rating scale (ADHD-\nRS) which was reduced to 25 following improvements of the sleep \npatterns at the dose of 2 mg and 22 at the dose of 3 mg. \nC12 - 6-year-old male diagnosed with insomnia at age 3 years, \nand with ADHD with comorbid tics and anxiety at age 4.5 years. \nThe child was first treated with IRM (1.9 mg daily), without major \nimprovement (SOL 55 min, NOA 5-7/night, 3-8 min each, and LSE 2 \nh). During the daytime, the child showed anxiety and tics, worsening \nat bedtime.\nPedPRM (1 mg escalated to 3 mg two weeks later) led to significant \nimprovement in the child's sleep patterns (SOL 15 min, LSE 4-5 \nh, NOA 2 per night, < 2 minutes each). Tics and bedtime anxiety \ndecreased. Parents reported improved well-being and satisfaction of \nchild\u2019s sleep pattern.\nDiscussion\nThis case report series typically highlights the challenge of treating \nchildren and adolescents with ADHD and insomnia. All children in \nthis report displayed typical sleep disturbances observed in ADHD, \nnamely difficulties initiating sleep with sleep onset latency (SOL) >30 \nmin and/or sleep maintenance problems reflected by 6 hours or less \nof uninterrupted sleep (LSE <6 h). In line with the literature [14], \nmost had less than recommended TST for their age before treatment \ninitiation [3]. Moreover, stimulant medications used as first line \nADHD treatment have the potential to further increase sleep latency \n[39-42].\nInitial treatment for insomnia included 3 cases of recommended \nprior sleep hygiene and behavioral interventions and/or IRM with \npartial or no improvements: Cases 5 and 12 \u2013 no improvement, case \n6 improved in SOL and TST but not in sleep maintenance. The other \n9 cases did not take any drug for their sleep impairments before \nPedPRM was initiated. \nNine cases attained treatment goals with PedPRM treatment: \nTST within the recommended range for the subject age [43]; SOL \n<30 min; LSE >6 h [37], and 3 cases met treatment goals in only 2 \nout of 3 parameters. In parallel, all children improved their daytime \nperformance patterns, and all parents reported improved daily \nfunctioning, feeling less exhausted, more rested and satisfied with \ntheir child\u2019s sleep and behaviour. \nTo our knowledge, this case series is the first report of PedPRM \nuse in the clinic for insomnia in children and adolescents with ADHD \nand provides supportive evidence to data from controlled clinical \ntrials with this drug in this condition.\nConclusion\nBased on our report, insomnia in children with ADHD tends \nto be persistent and is highly challenging to the child and parents. \nFollowing initial sleep hygiene measures and cognitive behavioral \ninterventions, many children with ADHD and insomnia require"
