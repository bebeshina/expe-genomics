\section{Introduction}
The present article introduces the setup and the first results of a method grounded in the domain specific structured resources use.
It implements llm context engineering and uses llm reasoning capacities in order to be able to return genes that are likely to be related to some
medical condition as observed in medical reports and explain its response. The main idea of this ongoing work is to propose a relatively simple approach
to tackle the complex problem of context augmented generation in the medical domain. The approach fully relies on publicly available resources and data.
As part of the ongoing work and to support further community efforts, we share the intermediary resource and the current implementation.
\section{The experiment}
The experiment preprocesses the domain specific annotations in order to set uo a graph of annotations. We are aware of
\subsection{Resources}
The main resources we used at the current stage of our experiment have been the disease and gene annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology project\footnote{\url{https://hpo.jax.org}}
The coverage varies from one annotation file to another.
We made the following assumptions:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item The knowledge about the diseases, the genes and the related data available in the HPO annotations can be represented as a graph where neighborhood subgraphs could be used for structured summary generation to be vectorized  as part of a RAG or Context enfineering process
 \item The graph can be structured as a (lexical) semantic network where nodes can be anything : natural language terms, definitions, categories, labels, word senses.
 The initial representational freedom gives space for discovery of potential connexions and subgraph structures. If the relations of the network are typed as "associations" at first, they can further evolve towards more expressive relation types such as isa, cause, has_part etc.
 Similarly, the initially undirected graph can become directed and weighted if a reliable weighting strategy can be discovered.
 \item
 \end{enumerate}
This vision of the gene-disease-phenotype context building process where instead of providing some local context (i. e. vectorized text with its contextual relations) we build a general network to support tsearch and reasoning
\subsection{Experimental Steps}
\subsection{Evaluation}
The evaluation is done through the existence test against reference or adversary (does this disease exist?). Reciprocity test : gene to desease muste return similar nodes with d√©sease to gene
