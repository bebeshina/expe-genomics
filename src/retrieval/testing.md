_An 18-year-old patient with hip fractures and renal osteodystrophy._

**1st run** : 
FBN1: gene associated with Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome can cause hip fractures due to weak connective tissue in the bones
OPN: gene associated with Osteopontin, which plays a role in bone density and may be related to osteodystrophy.
CLCN7: gene associated with renal tubular acidosis type 1. Renal osteodystrophy can occur as part of this condition due to kidney dysfunction.
Score : 0.76

**2d run**:
FBN1 : associated with Marfan syndrome, a disorder of the connective tissue in the body. Marfan syndrome can cause hip fractures and renal osteodystrophy due to the abnormal structure of collagen fibers.
VDR : Vitamin D Receptor. This gene plays a crucial role in regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism in the body.
ACAN: involved in the production of aggrecan, a protein that helps maintain cartilage structure and function.
Score : 0.76

**3rd run** : 
FBN1: gene associated with Marfan syndrome, which can cause hip fractures due to osteoporosis and renal osteodystrophy.
CLCN7: gene that encodes for a protein involved in the regulation of sodium chloride transport. CLCN7 mutations can also lead to other conditions such as renal tubular acidosis, which can cause renal osteodystrophy.
ESM1 : gene that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, but it has also been linked to Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders. The involvement of ESM1 in these conditions may be related to its role in endothelial function and collagen synthesis.

_Infant Girl. Age: 2 years. Weight: 12 kg. Diagnosis: Sickle cell disease. Treatment: Pain management and hydroxyurea therapy._

**1st run**
HBA1 : directly linked to the production of hemoglobin in red blood cells and mutations in this gene have been associated with sickle cell anemia, a form of sickle cell disease.
Score: 0.76

**2nd run**
HBB: directly linked to sickle cell disease due to mutations that affect hemoglobin production.
HBA1: related to anemia.
Score: 0.84

**3rd run:**
HBB: provides instructions for making the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Mutations in this gene can lead to sickle cell disease, which is characterized by abnormally shaped (sickle-shaped) red blood cells that can get stuck in small blood vessels, leading to pain and other complications.
HBA1:provides instructions for making the alpha-globin subunit of hemoglobin. While mutations in this gene do not cause sickle cell disease on their own, they can increase the severity of the condition when combined with beta-thalassemia mutations

_We present the case of a 68-year-old male with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction \n(HFrEF), chronic coronary syndrome, and multiple prior percutaneous coronary interventions \n(PCI), who developed a large left ventricular thrombus alongside acute hepatic and renal failure.\nThe patient was admitted in critical condition due to worsening heart failure, reporting \nprogressive dyspnea and a decline in exercise tolerance over two weeks. Four days before admission, \nhe developed petechial skin lesions. On examination, he presented with cachexia, jaundice, \nconfusion, and hypotension. Laboratory tests indicated severe hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin \n5.2 mg/dL, ALT 311 U/L, AST 322 U/L), renal impairment (creatinine 3.9 mg/dL, eGFR 15 mL/\nmin), thrombocytopenia (platelet count 140 x10\u2079/L), and an elevated INR of 4.33 despite no vitamin \nK antagonist therapy. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction (EF 20%) and a massive thrombus (59 \u00d7 29 mm) occupying half of the ventricular \ncavity. (Figure A, B, )\nGiven the hemodynamic instability and hepatic dysfunction, standard heart failure medications \nwere discontinued, and anticoagulation with enoxaparin was initiated at 40 mg twice daily, later \nincreased to 60 mg after an improvement in renal function. Supportive measures, including hepatoprotective therapy and volume resuscitation, were implemented. Follow-up echocardiography after four days demonstrated partial thrombus resolution, with a fragmented mass reduced to 17 \nmm. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) confirmed the presence of an apical thrombus and excluded left ventricular wall rupture.Despite transient hepatic and renal improvement, the patient's condition deteriorated due to refractory hypotension that required norepinephrine and oliguria._

_A 55-year-old male patient was referred to our emergency department with 
right lower abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed an ileocecal 
intussusception, and a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed due to a cystic lesion at 
the cecum. Following resection, improved exposure revealed multiple mucinous peritoneal foci, 
suggestive of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Histopathology confirmed the presence of LAMN with 
peritoneal metastasis consistent with pseudomyxoma peritonei._

_We report the case of a young male who presented with malaise, peripheral 
edema, chest pain, fevers, and a productive cough, but without the cardinal symptoms of rash or 
early joint involvement typically associated with AOSD. Initial evaluations suggested infectious and 
autoimmune etiologies, leading to treatment with multiple antibiotics, colchicine, and doxycycline. 
The patient’s condition was further complicated by pericardial effusion, persistent systemic 
inflammation, and delayed onset of arthritis during hospitalization._
